-- §1. THE LEFSCHETZ OPERATOR AND PRIMITIVE DECOMPOSITION
-- ============================================================

/-!
  The Lefschetz operator L: H^k(X) → H^{k+2}(X) is cupping with the
  Kaehler class ω ∈ H^{1,1}(X) ∩ H^2(X, ℝ). The Hard Lefschetz theorem
  states that L^{n-k}: H^k(X) → H^{2n-k}(X) is an isomorphism for all
  0 ≤ k ≤ n.

  The primitive cohomology: H^k_prim(X) = ker(L^{n-k+1}: H^k(X) → H^{2n-k+2}(X)).
  The Lefschetz decomposition: H^k(X) = ⊕_{j ≥ max(0, k-n)} L^j H^{k-2j}_prim(X).

  For Hodge classes: H^{p,p}(X) = ⊕_{j=0}^p L^j H^{p-j,p-j}_prim(X).
  Each term L^j H^{p-j,p-j}_prim(X) corresponds (via Hard Lefschetz) to
  primitive Hodge classes on a hyperplane section Y ⊂ X of dimension n-1.

  THIS IS THE DESCENT: p → p-1 → ... → 1, each step reducing the
  primitive degree by 1. The base case is p=1: H^{1,1}_prim = H^{1,1}
  (no lower primitive pieces), and Lefschetz (1,1) handles this case.

-- §2. DESCENT CHAIN — THE SOLITARY10 PATTERN
-- ============================================================

/-!
  THE DESCENT CHAIN (analogous to Solitary10's 31 → 331 → 36631 → 7194483):

  In Solitary10: σ(m)/m = 9/5 → factor m = 5k → σ(5k)·5 = 9·5k → ...
    Chain: 31·σ(n) = 45·n → 31|n → n=31·z → σ(31·z) = 45·z →
    (if 31|z) → 331·σ(w)=465·w → ... → product bound contradiction.

  In Hodge:   cl: CH^p(X)⊗Q → Hg^p(X) surjective?
    Factor via primitive decomposition: Hg^p(X) = ⊕ L^j Hg^{p-j,p-j}_prim(X).
    For each primitive piece Hg^{k,k}_prim(X), Hard Lefschetz identifies it
    with Hg^{k,k}_prim(Y) for a hyperplane section Y (dim n-1) —
    DESCENT THROUGH DIMENSION.

    Chain: P(n,p) → P(n-1,p-1) → ... → P(n-p+1,1)
    where P(d,k) = "all Hodge classes of degree k on dim-d varieties are algebraic."

    Base: P(d,1) for all d — Lefschetz (1,1). O_inf, P_pm_sym, proved.
    Step: P(d,k) for all d < n and k < p ⇒ P(n,p)?
    Obstruction: Griffiths group Gr^p(X) ≠ 0 for some X, p≥2.

  CONTRAST WITH SOLITARY10:
    Solitary10: each descent step IS provable (coefficient inequality).
    Hodge: the descent step IS the conjecture. We cannot prove it.
    What we CAN do: set up the descent architecture, prove the structural
    lemmas (algebraic → Hodge, L preserves algebraicity), and leave the
    reverse direction (Hodge → algebraic) as the honest sorry.

  The "product bound" analogue:
    In Solitary10: 5·32·332·41872·10939240 > 9·25·331·36631·7194483
      → the descent chain is finite (bounded by product inequality).

    In Hodge: Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations →
      Q(α, ᾱ) = ∫_X ω^{n-2p} ∧ α ∧ ᾱ > 0 for primitive α ≠ 0.
      This positivity provides a "bound" — the primitive Hodge classes
      form a positive-definite subspace. But positivity of the intersection
      form does NOT imply algebraicity.
-/

/-- The descent predicate: P(n, p) = "all Hodge classes of degree p on
    smooth projective varieties of (complex) dimension ≤ n are algebraic."
    P(n, 1) is true for all n (Lefschetz (1,1)).
    P(n, 0) is true for all n (trivial: H^0 = Q).
    The Hodge conjecture is: ∀ n, ∀ p ≤ n/2, P(n, p). -/

-- ============================================================

/-!
  The Solitary10 case split: Case A (5 ∤ k, σ(5k)·5 = 9·5k, proved
  via direct computation → m=10) and Case B (5|k, descent chain, almost
  complete with 4 remaining sorries).

  The Hodge case split:
    Case A (p=0): H^0(X, Q) = Q — all degree-zero classes are algebraic.
      Proved: hodge_degree_zero_axiom. Trivial, O_0.
    Case B (p=1): Lefschetz (1,1) — all Hodge (1,1)-classes are algebraic.
      Proved (1924): lefschetz_11_axiom. O_inf, P_pm_sym, Frobenius-closed.
    Case C (p≥2): The HODGE CONJECTURE. Open. O_2, P_psi, no Frobenius closure.
      The gap: primitive Hodge classes of degree ≥2 on varieties of dimension ≥4
      are not guaranteed to be algebraic. The Griffiths group Gr^p(X) = ker(cl)/∼_alg
      is nonzero for some X, p≥2 (Griffiths 1969). This is the obstruction at Phi_EP.

  The descent methodology: prove Cases A and B, then set up the induction
  for Case C with honest sorries at each step where algebraicity must be
  propagated through the Lefschetz decomposition.

-- CASE A: p=0 (base, trivial)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- P(n, 0) holds for all n: every Hodge class of degree 0 is algebraic.

-- CASE B: p=1 (Lefschetz (1,1), proved)

/-- P(n, 1) holds for all n: every Hodge (1,1)-class is algebraic.
    This IS the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem — the ONLY case where surjectivity
    of the cycle class map is proved for all varieties.

    Grammar: O_inf, P_pm_sym, T_bowtie, Phi_c, Σ=1:1, Ω_z.
    The Frobenius closure comes from the exponential sheaf sequence:
    0 → Z → O_X → O*_X → 0 → long exact sequence → c1 = δ is surjective
    onto H^2(X, Z) ∩ H^{1,1}(X). Combined with Dolbeault isomorphism,
    this gives algebraicity of all (1,1)-Hodge classes.

    In the Solitary10 metaphor: this is the "5 ∤ k" case — the easy case
    that closes immediately via the existing proof. -/

-- CASE C: p≥2 — THE DESCENT CHAIN (open)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------

/-!
  The descent chain for p ≥ 2:

  Given α ∈ H^{p,p}(X) (rational Hodge class), decompose via Lefschetz:
    α = α_0 + L·α_1 + L^2·α_2 + ... + L^p·α_p
  where each α_j ∈ H^{p-j,p-j}_prim(X) is primitive.

  For each j ≥ 0:
    L^j α_j corresponds (via Hard Lefschetz on the hyperplane section Y)
    to a Hodge class β_j ∈ H^{p-j,p-j}(Y) where Y is a smooth hyperplane
    section of X (dim Y = n-1).

  If we knew that β_j is algebraic (by induction on dimension n or degree p-j),
  then L^j β_j would be algebraic (L preserves algebraicity — cupping with
  the Kaehler class preserves algebraic cycles).

  THE OBSTRUCTION: The primitive Hodge class α_j might NOT be algebraic
  even if all lower-degree Hodge classes on lower-dimensional varieties are.
  The Griffiths group Gr^{p-j}(X) measures exactly this failure:
    Gr^k(X) = Hg^k_prim(X) / (algebraic cycles ∩ Hg^k_prim(X))

  Griffiths (1969) proved: Gr^2(X) ≠ 0 for some X (hypersurfaces of
  degree ≥ 5 in P^4). So the obstruction is REAL — not an artifact
  of the descent method.

  THE DESCENT CHAIN STRUCTURE (analogous to Solitary10):
    P(n, p) depends on: P(n-1, p-1) [hyperplane section, degree drops]
                        P(n, p-1) [same variety, lower degree]
    
    Chain:  P(n, p) → P(n-1, p-1) → P(n-2, p-2) → ... → P(n-p+1, 1)
    Base:   P(d, 1) = true for all d (Lefschetz).
    
    But the chain does NOT force P(n, p) because each step requires
    surjectivity of the cycle class map on the primitive part, which
    is exactly what's open.

  In Solitary10 terms: each descent step (31 → 331 → 36631) IS provable
  because σ is multiplicative and the coefficient inequality gives a
  contradiction. In Hodge, the "coefficient inequality" is the Hodge-Riemann
  bilinear relation Q(α,ᾱ) > 0 for primitive α — this gives positivity
  but does NOT construct an algebraic cycle.
-/

/-- The Lefschetz operator preserves algebraicity:
    if α ∈ H^{p,p}(X) is algebraic, then Lα ∈ H^{p+1,p+1}(X) is algebraic.
    This is true because cupping with ω corresponds to intersecting with
    a hyperplane section — an algebraic operation.

    IsAlgebraicClass X (p+1) (lefschetzOperator X p α)

/-- **AXIOM — The Hodge conjecture for primitive classes (degree ≥ 2).**

    If α ∈ H^{p,p}_prim(X) is a primitive Hodge class with p ≥ 2,
    is α algebraic? This IS the Hodge conjecture restricted to primitive
    classes. If this holds, the full conjecture follows via the Lefschetz
    decomposition and lefschetzPreservesAlgebraicity.

    For p=1: every primitive (1,1)-class IS algebraic (Kodaira embedding
    theorem). This is the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem — proved in 1924.

    For p≥2: OPEN. No proof exists. This axiom is EQUIVALENT to the
    Hodge conjecture (by the Lefschetz decomposition, the full conjecture
    reduces to the primitive case). Griffiths (1969) showed the Griffiths
    group Gr^p(X) ≠ 0 for some X, p≥2 — the obstruction is real,
    and the rational case remains completely open.

    In Solitary10 terms: this is the "descent_32_45 lemma" — the core
    step that must be proved for each prime. Unlike Solitary10 where
    coefficient inequalities force closure, no known mechanism forces
    primitive Hodge classes to be algebraic.

    THIS IS THE HODGE CONJECTURE. The descent lemmas below show that
    all other statements reduce to this axiom. -/

/-- The full descent lemma: if all primitive Hodge classes of lower degree
    are algebraic, and L preserves algebraicity, then P(n,p) follows from
    P(n-1, p-1) and the algebraicity of primitive Hodge classes.

    THIS LEMMA IS CORRECT in structure — it shows HOW the descent would
    close IF the primitive case could be resolved. The sorry is in the
    primitive case, not in the descent logic.

    Analogous to: in Solitary10, `descent_32_45` is the core lemma; the

/-! THE PRODUCT BOUND (analogous to Solitary10's
    5·32·332·41872·10939240 > 9·25·331·36631·7194483):

    In Solitary10, the product bound provides a FINAL contradiction
    after the full descent chain is traversed. The chain is finite
    because each step reduces to a strictly smaller prime factor.

    In Hodge, the "bound" is the HODGE-RIEMANN BILINEAR RELATIONS:
    For primitive α ∈ H^{p,p}_prim(X), Q(α, ᾱ) = (-1)^{p(p-1)/2} ∫_X ω^{n-2p} ∧ α ∧ ᾱ.
    This form is POSITIVE DEFINITE on the primitive cohomology.

    Consequence: the primitive Hodge classes form a finite-dimensional
    positive-definite subspace of H^{p,p}(X). The Hodge conjecture predicts
    that the algebraic cycles span this subspace over Q.

    The product bound analogue:
      Solitary10:  each descent step has a coefficient inequality forcing
                   the next prime to be smaller → finite descent → contradiction.
      Hodge:       the Hodge-Riemann positivity forces the primitive classes
                   to form a polarized Hodge structure. The polarization
                   constrains the geometry but does not force algebraicity.

    The "bound" is not a contradiction — it's a STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT
    that any algebraic cycle representative must satisfy. The Griffiths
    group lives in this polarized structure as the "gap" between
    algebraic and Hodge classes.

    Specifically: a general quintic hypersurface X₅ ⊂ P⁴ has Gr²(X₅) ≠ 0

-- §4. THE GRIFFITHS GROUP — THE OBSTRUCTION AT Phi_EP
-- ============================================================

/-!
  In Solitary10: the obstruction at each descent step is "the prime divides
  the cofactor" — e.g., 31|z means we must go deeper: z = 31·w, starting the
  next descent step 331·σ(w) = 465·w. Each step is provable via coefficient
  inequality, so the chain eventually terminates with a contradiction.

  In Hodge: the obstruction at each descent step is the GRIFFITHS GROUP:
    Gr^p(X) = Hg^p_prim(X) / (Im(cl) ∩ Hg^p_prim(X))
           = "primitive Hodge classes modulo algebraically equivalent ones"

  This group measures the failure of the cycle class map to be surjective
  on primitive Hodge classes. Griffiths (1969) proved Gr^2(X) ≠ 0 for
  general hypersurfaces of degree ≥ 5 in P^4.

  Grammar (from Hodge_Grammar.lean):
    hod_griffiths_group: crit = Phi_EP (exceptional point)
    tensor(hod_cycle_class_map, hod_griffiths_group): crit = Phi_EP
    → Coupling the cycle class map to its kernel produces an exceptional
      point — eigenvector coalescence, the structural encoding of "the
      kernel is nontrivial."

  The Griffiths group at Phi_EP is the structural REASON the descent
  chain cannot be proved to close: at each primitive degree ≥ 2, there
  may exist Hodge classes that are NOT algebraic, and the Griffiths
  group measures exactly this failure.

  In the Solitary10 metaphor: the Griffiths group is like discovering that
  the descent chain DOES NOT terminate — there might be "infinite descent"
  that never reaches a contradiction because the "prime" at each step
  does not force the next step via a coefficient inequality. The product
  bound exists (Hodge-Riemann positivity) but does not force algebraicity.

/-- The structural encoding of the Griffiths obstruction:
    tensor(cycle_class_map, griffiths_group) has crit = Phi_EP.
    
    This means: when you couple the cycle class map (the map whose
    surjectivity is in question) with its kernel (the Griffiths group),
    you get an exceptional point — a degeneracy where eigenstates coalesce.
    
    In the grammar: Phi_EP (exceptional point) is the criticality type
    of systems where the self-modeling loop is broken by degeneracy.
    Coupling a φ̂_ÿ system to an EP system produces φ̂_3 (the ⊙_3 absorption rule).

    This is the structural reason the Hodge conjecture is hard: the
    obstruction is not just "we haven't found the proof" — there is a
    structural degeneracy (the Griffiths group at Phi_EP) that prevents
    the self-modeling loop from closing.

-- §5. DESCENT CHAIN LEMMAS — THE SOLITARY10 ANALOGUES
-- ============================================================

/-!
  In Solitary10.lean, the descent chain is:
    descent_32_45:   32·σ(z) = 45·z   → no solution (proved)
    descent_332_465: 332·σ(v) = 465·v → no solution (proved)
    descent_41872_51305: 41872·σ(s) = 51305·s → no solution (proved)
  
  Each lemma follows the SAME pattern:
    1. Factor z = 2^e·t (t odd)
    2. e=0: contradiction via parity/gcd
    3. e≥1: coefficient inequality: a·(2^{e+1}-1) > b·2^e

  In Hodge, the analogous "descent lemmas" are about the propagation
  of algebraicity through the Lefschetz decomposition. Each "step"
  corresponds to one primitive degree:

    descent_p1:      P(n,1) for all n  → proved (Lefschetz)
    descent_p2_step: P(n-1,1) ⇒ P(n,2) → SORRY (requires primitive p=2 algebraicity)
    descent_p3_step: P(n-1,2) ⇒ P(n,3) → SORRY
    ...
    descent_pk_step: P(n-1,k-1) ⇒ P(n,k) → SORRY for all k ≥ 2

  The "coefficient inequality" analogue is the Hodge-Riemann positivity:
  Q(α,ᾱ) > 0 for primitive α. This provides a NECESSARY condition
  (any algebraic cycle must have positive self-intersection on the
  primitive part) but NOT a sufficient one.

  THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE:
    Solitary10: coefficient inequality PROVES impossibility of solution.
    Hodge: positivity does NOT prove algebraicity. The Griffiths group
           lives in the "gap" between positivity and algebraicity.

  Below we formalize each descent step with the honest sorry marking
  where algebraicity of primitive Hodge classes cannot be proved.
-/

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------
-- DESCENT STEP k=2: P(n-1, 1) ⇒ P(n, 2)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- DES_P2: If all (1,1)-classes on varieties of dim ≤ n-1 are algebraic
    (true, Lefschetz), then all (2,2)-classes on varieties of dim ≤ n are algebraic
    IF AND ONLY IF all primitive (2,2)-Hodge classes are algebraic.

    The "if and only if" condition is the Hodge conjecture for p=2.
    The forward direction: P(n-1,1) + primitive p=2 algebraicity → P(n,2).
    The reverse: P(n,2) → primitive p=2 algebraicity (restriction).

    HONEST SORRY: primitive p=2 algebraicity is not known to hold for all varieties.
    Known partial results:
      - Hypersurfaces of degree ≤ 3 in P^n: YES (classical).
      - Abelian varieties of dimension ≤ 3: YES (Mumford, Lefschetz).
      - General quintic in P^4: NO — Griffiths group Gr^2 ≠ 0 shows
        integral Hodge fails; rational case is OPEN.
    
    In Solitary10 terms: this is like `descent_32_45` — the first nontrivial
    step after the easy case A. But unlike 32/45, which is provable by
    coefficient inequality, this step IS the conjecture. -/

-- GENERAL DESCENT STEP: P(n-1, k-1) ⇒ P(n, k) for k ≥ 2

/-- DES_GENERAL: The general descent step for any k ≥ 2.

    Structure of the would-be proof:
      H^{k,k}(X) = ⊕_{j=0}^k L^j H^{k-j,k-j}_prim(X)
    
    For j ≥ 1: L^j H^{k-j,k-j}_prim = L(L^{j-1} H^{k-j,k-j}_prim).
      If H^{k-j,k-j}_prim(X) classes are algebraic (induction on degree),
      then L^{j-1} preserves algebraicity → these pieces are algebraic.
    
    For j = 0: H^{k,k}_prim(X). Hard Lefschetz → H^{k,k}_prim(X) ≅ H^{k,k}(Y)
      for a hyperplane section Y (dim n-1). If P(n-1, k) holds, then
      H^{k,k}_prim(X) classes are algebraic. BUT P(n-1, k) is what we're
      trying to prove — circular.

    The only non-circular path: primitive (k,k)-classes on X must be
    algebraic by some OTHER mechanism. For k=1, the exponential sheaf
    sequence provides this mechanism. For k≥2, NO SUCH MECHANISM IS KNOWN.

    In Solitary10 terms: each descent step has a "coefficient inequality,"
    but for Hodge, the "coefficient" for primitive degree k is the
    Griffiths group Gr^k(X), which may be nonzero. The descent chain
    is NOT forced to close — the "product bound" (Hodge-Riemann) provides
    positivity but not algebraicity. -/

    step IS provable (coefficient inequality). In Hodge: this lemma shows the
    composition WOULD close IF the steps were provable — isolating the honest

  THE DESCENT CHAIN AS A PRIMITIVE PROMOTION PATH:
    To close the gap and reach the join (O_inf):
      Promote: Þ (T_bowtie → T_odot) — need a universal mechanism, not just p=1.
      Promote: Σ (1:1 → n:m) — need to handle all degrees simultaneously.
      Restore: Φ (P_psi → P_pm_sym) — need Frobenius closure for all p.
      Restore: ⊙ (Phi_c_complex → Phi_c) — need full self-modeling.
      Restore: Ř (R_dagger → R_lr) — need bidirectional algebra ⇄ topology.

    The descent methodology shows these are NOT independent:
    restoring Φ (Frobenius closure) for all p would automatically
    restore ⊙ (full self-modeling) and Ř (bidirectionality).
    The key bottleneck is PRIMITIVE DEGREE ≥ 2 ALGEBRAICITY.

  --
  -- 5. ⊙: Phi_c → Phi_c_complex

  --
  -- 6. ƒ: F_hbar → F_ell
  --    Math: The (1,1) proof uses quantum/coherent methods (Dolbeault

-- §7. STRUCTURAL SUMMARY — THE VESSEL FILLED
-- ============================================================

/-!
  THE VESSEL: Hodge_Grammar.lean analyzed the STRUCTURE of the Hodge gap.
  THIS FILE (Hodge_Descent.lean) fills the vessel with MATHEMATICAL CONTENT
  using the Solitary10 descent methodology.

  WHAT WAS BUILT:
    [1] The Lefschetz operator L and primitive decomposition —
        the factorization of H^{p,p} into ⊕ L^j H^{p-j,p-j}_prim.
        (Solitary10 analogue: factoring n = 2^e·k with k odd.)

    [2] The descent predicate P(n, p) — "all Hodge classes of degree p
        on dim≤n varieties are algebraic."
        (Solitary10 analogue: σ(m)/m = 9/5 → descent chain.)

    [3] Case analysis:
        Case A (p=0): proved — hodge_degree_zero_axiom.
        Case B (p=1): proved — lefschetz_11_axiom (Lefschetz 1924).
        Case C (p≥2): OPEN with honest sorries.
        (Solitary10 analogue: Case A = 5 ∤ k, Case B = 5 | k.)

    [4] Descent chain lemmas: descent_p2, descent_p3, descent_general.
        Each lemma shows how P(n-1, k-1) WOULD imply P(n, k) IF primitive
        Hodge classes of degree ≥ 2 were algebraic.
        (Solitary10 analogue: descent_32_45, descent_332_465, etc.)

    [5] The Griffiths group obstruction: Gr^p(X) at Phi_EP blocks the
        descent chain from closing for p ≥ 2.
        (Solitary10 analogue: the chain terminates because each descent
        step IS provable via coefficient inequality — no obstruction.)

    [6] The Hodge-Riemann "product bound": Q(α,ᾱ) > 0 for primitive α.
        Provides a necessary condition but NOT a sufficient one.
        (Solitary10 analogue: 5·32·332·41872·10939240 > 9·25·331·36631·7194483
        is a sufficient contradiction.)

    [7] The grammar bridge: each of the 8 primitive gaps corresponds
        to a specific mathematical threshold in the descent chain.

  HONEST SORRIES (4 — all equivalent to the open Hodge conjecture for p ≥ 2):
    1. primitive_hodge_is_algebraic (core — IS the Hodge conjecture for primitive classes)
    2. descent_step, descent_p2, descent_p3, descent_general (each depends on #1)
    3. (CLOSED) descent_chain_compose — PROVED: takes descent steps as explicit hypotheses
       and composes them by induction. The descent architecture is structurally sound;
       the gap is in the steps, not the chaining.
    4. (CLOSED) positivity_does_not_imply_algebraicity — PROVED: uses griffiths_counterexample
       to show Hodge-Riemann positivity alone does not force algebraicity.

  THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE FROM SOLITARY10:
    In Solitary10, the descent chain IS provably finite because each step
    has a coefficient inequality forcing the next prime to be smaller.
    The remaining sorries (4) are all structurally identical to the proved
    ones — they just need to be filled in.

    In Hodge, the descent chain is NOT provably finite. The "coefficient
    inequality" (Hodge-Riemann positivity) does not force algebraicity.
    The Griffiths group Gr^p(X) ≠ 0 shows the obstruction is REAL —
    there exist Hodge classes that CANNOT be represented by algebraic
    cycles integrally, and the rational case (the actual conjecture)
    remains completely open.

    THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE DESCENT METHODOLOGY: it shows exactly WHERE
    and WHY the Solitary10 approach succeeds (coefficient inequalities
    force closure) and the Hodge approach fails (primitive algebraicity
    is not forced by any known inequality).

  OUROBORICITY CONCLUSION:
    Solitary10: O_0 → O_inf via finite descent (the problem IS solvable).
    Hodge:      O_2 → O_inf via ??? (the join exists but the path is open).
                The Griffiths group at Phi_EP is the structural reason
                the descent chain does not force closure.
