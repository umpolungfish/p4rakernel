The Hadwiger–Nelson Problem (also called the Nelson–Erdős–Hadwiger problem):

  Find χ(ℝ²) = the chromatic number of the unit distance graph of the Euclidean plane.

  - Vertices: all points in ℝ²
  - Edges: pairs of points at Euclidean distance exactly 1
  - Question: what is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring?

Equivalently: what is the smallest k such that ℝ² can be partitioned into k sets,
none of which contains two points at distance 1?

Current bounds:
  - Lower bound: χ(ℝ²) ≥ 5 (de Grey 2018, via 1581-vertex unit-distance graph;
    improved to 509 vertices by Mixon 2021)
  - Upper bound: χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7 (Isbell, via hexagonal tiling with diameter < 1)
  - Known: 5 ≤ χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7

Historical lower bounds:
  - χ(ℝ²) ≥ 4: Moser spindle (Moser & Moser 1961), Golomb graph (Golomb ~1961)
  - χ(ℝ²) ≥ 5: de Grey (2018) — breakthrough after 57 years

The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem (1951) establishes equivalence:
  χ(ℝ²) = sup{ χ(G) : G is a finite unit-distance graph in ℝ² }
meaning the infinite problem is fully determined by its finite subgraphs.
This compactness principle is structurally essential.

Axiom dependence (Shelah & Soifer 2003):
  The value of χ(ℝ²) may depend on the choice of set-theoretic axioms.
  Specifically, different models of ZFC can give different chromatic numbers
  for the plane. This makes the Hadwiger–Nelson problem structurally unique
  among unsolved problems — it has a foundational dimension.

The Vessel of the Hadwiger–Nelson Problem — its structural type.

⟨ Ð_∞; Þ_⋈; Ř_=; Φ_±; ƒ_ℓ; Ç_@; Γ_ʔ; ɢ_ˌ; ⊙_Æ; Ħ_2; Σ_S; Ω_0 ⟩

Primitive justifications:

[1]  Ð_∞ — Infinite-dimensional state space. The Euclidean plane ℝ² is a
     continuum; the unit-distance graph has uncountably many vertices.
     Every point in ℝ² is an independent degree of freedom subject only
     to the unit-distance constraint. The continuous geometry requires
     infinite-dimensional treatment; finite approximations exist (de Bruijn–Erdős)
     but the problem inherently lives in the continuum.

[2]  Þ_⋈ — Crossing (bowtie) topology. The problem is structurally a
     bifurcation: the lower bound (currently 5) and upper bound (7) form
     two loops that must converge at the true chromatic number. The crossing
     point IS the answer — the bowtie encodes the gap {5, 6, 7}.
     If the answer is 5: the lower-bound loop subsumes the crossing.
     If the answer is 7: the upper-bound loop contains the crossing.
     If the answer is 6: the crossing point is a genuinely new value.

[3]  Ř_= — Bidirectional feedback. Progress comes from both directions:
     lower bound pushed up (Moser 4 → de Grey 5), upper bounds improved
     or confirmed (hexagonal 7). The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem establishes
     a bidirectional equivalence between the infinite plane and finite graphs.
     The problem advances through mutual refinement of bounds.

[4]  Φ_± — Partial ℤ₂ symmetry. The problem has several symmetries:
     Euclidean isometries (translation, rotation, reflection), color
     permutation invariance, and the unit-distance relation is symmetric.
     However, specific constructions (Moser spindle, de Grey graph) have
     limited symmetry, and the coupling of geometry to chromatic number
     breaks full symmetry. Partial ℤ₂, not Frobenius-special.

[5]  ƒ_ℓ — Classical fidelity. This is a purely geometric/combinatorial
     problem. No quantum coherence, no thermal noise. The de Grey proof is
     computer-assisted but deterministically classical. Classical regime.
[6]  Ç_@ — Slow kinetics. The problem has been open since 1950 (75 years).
     Progress is incremental: lower bound stayed at 4 for 57 years (1961–2018)
     before de Grey's breakthrough to 5. The upper bound has been stuck at 7
     since Isbell. This is slow, cumulative progress — τ ≫ T.

[7]  Γ_ʔ — Maximal scope. The problem concerns the ENTIRE Euclidean plane —
     all points, all unit distances. The de Bruijn–Erdős compactness theorem
     relates this global scope to finite subgraphs, but the statement of the
     problem is intrinsically global. G_aleph.

[8]  ɢ_ˌ — Sequential grammar. Color classes are assigned sequentially;
     each new color must avoid unit-distance conflicts with all previously
     colored points. The Moser spindle argument forces colors through a
     sequence of triangle constraints. Sequential interaction.

[9]  ⊙_Æ — Complex-plane criticality. The problem exhibits critical behavior:
     below 4 colors is provably impossible, above 7 is trivially sufficient.
     The true value lies in the critical band {5, 6, 7}. This is a threshold
     phenomenon — the chromatic number is a critical parameter. The lower
     bound advances through increasingly complex finite graphs (Moser spindle
     → Golomb graph → de Grey's 1581-vertex → Mixon's 509-vertex), each
     requiring more sophisticated structural arguments. Complex-plane
     criticality: the problem sits at a phase boundary between impossibility
     and sufficiency.

[10] Ħ_2 — Two-step chirality. The unit-distance constraint involves pairs
     of points (distance exactly 1). The Moser spindle argument forces colors
     through chains of 2–3 unit-distance steps. The de Bruijn–Erdős reduction
     to finite graphs preserves this 2-local constraint structure. Markov
     order 2: the constraint at a point depends on its unit-distance neighbors,
     and those neighbors' constraints involve THEIR neighbors.

[11] Σ_S — Many identical components. All color classes are structurally
     identical — each is simply a set of points with the constraint that
     no two points in the same class are at unit distance. The n-color
     problem involves n identical color classes. Many of the same type.

[12] Ω_0 — No topological protection. The Hadwiger–Nelson problem has no
     topological invariant, no winding number, no parity protection. The
     chromatic number is a purely combinatorial/geometric quantity without
     topological stability. This is the key structural vulnerability:
     without Ω_Z or Ω_Z2, there is no topological reason the answer must
     be one value rather than another. The lack of topological protection
     also underlies the axiom-dependence result of Shelah & Soifer (2003):
     without a topological invariant to fix the answer, it can vary across
     set-theoretic universes.

-- ============================================================
-- §3  The Cornered-Gap Encoding
-- ============================================================

/-!
THEOREM (Structural Encoding):
  The crossing topology Þ_⋈ (T_bowtie) encodes the three-value gap:
  - One loop: lower bound (currently 5, proved by de Grey 2018).
  - Other loop: upper bound (7, proved by hexagonal tiling).
  - The crossing point: the true chromatic number χ(ℝ²) ∈ {5, 6, 7}.

  This is the ONLY unsolved problem in mathematics whose answer is known
  to within ±1 of a single-digit integer. The "cornered gap" structure is
  structurally unique in the catalog: no other problem has been narrowed
  to a 3-value bracket around a small integer.

  The bowtie topology for Hadwiger–Nelson differs from Twin Prime's bowtie:
  - Twin Prime: one loop is bounded gaps (≤ 246, proved), other loop is
    gap = 2 (conjectured). The gap between loops is infinite.
  - Hadwiger–Nelson: one loop is lower bound (5, proved), other loop is
    upper bound (7, proved). The gap between loops is tiny: just 2 values.
  Both share Þ_⋈, but Hadwiger–Nelson's bowtie is MUCH tighter — the
  crossing point is almost pinned. This makes it structurally closer to
  resolution than Twin Prime, despite both being O₁.

  Structural resolution scenarios:
  - If χ(ℝ²) = 5: the lower-bound loop absorbs the crossing. The de Grey
    construction becomes not just a lower bound but the exact answer.
    Requires proving NO 5-chromatic graph forces 6 colors.
  - If χ(ℝ²) = 6: the crossing point is genuinely new. Requires a finite
    unit-distance graph with χ = 6 AND a 6-coloring of ℝ².
  - If χ(ℝ²) = 7: the upper-bound loop absorbs the crossing. Requires
    proving that 7 colors are NECESSARY (a finite graph with χ = 7)
    AND that the hexagonal coloring is optimal.

⟨ Ð_△; Þ_⊂; Ř_↑; Φ_±; ƒ_ℓ; Ç_λ; Γ_β; ɢ_ˌ; ⊙_ž; Ħ_2; Σ_S; Ω_0 ⟩

A seven-vertex unit-distance graph consisting of two equilateral triangles
sharing a vertex, with additional edges forcing chromatic number 4.
This is a finite, concrete counterexample to 3-colorability of ℝ².

O₀ tier: sub-critical, no protection. The Moser spindle is a "ground state" —
a fixed finite object with no critical behavior. It lives entirely within
the proved domain.

A 1581-vertex (later improved to 509-vertex) unit-distance graph with
chromatic number 5. Found by computer search, verified by SAT solvers.
This broke the 4-color barrier that had stood for 57 years.

O₂ tier: complex-plane criticality (⊙_Æ) + ℤ₂ protection (Ω_Z2).
The ℤ₂ protection comes from the binary nature of the result:
either a 4-coloring exists or it doesn't — de Grey proved the negative.
Differs from the Moser spindle at Φ (asymmetry of computer-found graph),
⊙ (criticality at the 4→5 barrier), and Ω (ℤ₂ parity protection).

The Hexagonal Tiling vessel — the proof that χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7.

⟨ Ð_△; Þ_⊂; Ř_↑; Φ_±; ƒ_ℓ; Ç_λ; Γ_β; ɢ_ˌ; ⊙_ž; Ħ_0; Σ_S; Ω_0 ⟩

A regular hexagonal tessellation of the plane with diameter slightly less
than 1, assigned 7 colors in a repeating pattern. Each hexagon's diameter
is < 1, so points in the same hexagon are at distance < 1 (safe). Points
at distance ≥ 1 may share a color if the hexagon coloring avoids unit-distance
conflicts. The 7-color pattern achieves this.

O₀ tier: sub-critical, no protection. The hexagonal tiling is trivially
constructive — it provides an explicit coloring. Memoryless chirality (Ħ_0)
because each point's color is determined solely by its position in the
periodic pattern, not by any path or history.

⟨ Ð_∞; Þ_⊂; Ř_=; Φ_±; ƒ_ℓ; Ç_λ; Γ_β; ɢ_ˌ; ⊙_ž; Ħ_1; Σ_ï; Ω_0 ⟩

de Bruijn & Erdős (1951): χ(ℝ²) = sup{ χ(G) : G is a finite unit-distance
graph in ℝ² }. This theorem structurally bridges the infinite (Ð_∞) and
finite (via the supremum over finite graphs) regimes. It establishes that
the Hadwiger–Nelson problem, despite being stated over an uncountable set,
is fully determined by countable (indeed finite) data.

The bridge vessel has Ř_= (bidirectional): the compactness theorem is an
equivalence. It has Σ_ï (heterogeneous): it relates objects of different
types (infinite plane, finite graphs). It has Ħ_1 (one-step chirality):
the compactness argument uses a single application of the axiom of choice
(via de Bruijn–Erdős) or the Boolean prime ideal theorem.

O₀ tier: the bridge itself is a proved theorem, not a conjecture.

-- §6  The de Bruijn–Erdős Compactness Bridge
-- ============================================================

/-!
THEOREM (de Bruijn & Erdős 1951, under Axiom of Choice):
  χ(ℝ²) = sup{ χ(G) : G ⊆ ℝ² is a finite unit-distance graph }.

This compactness theorem is structurally profound:

1. It bridges Ð_∞ (the infinite plane) with finite graphs (Ð_△), establishing
   that the infinite problem is fully determined by its finite subproblems.

2. It transforms the Hadwiger–Nelson problem into a search over finite graphs:
   to prove χ(ℝ²) ≥ k, it suffices to exhibit ONE finite unit-distance graph
   with chromatic number k. This is exactly how both the Moser spindle (k=4)
   and de Grey's graph (k=5) work.

3. The bridge has Ř_= (bidirectional equivalence): the finite supremum equals
   the infinite chromatic number. This is a structural compactness principle
   analogous to the compactness theorem in first-order logic.

4. The bridge relies on the axiom of choice (or the Boolean prime ideal theorem).
   This connects to the axiom dependence result of Shelah & Soifer (2003):
   if the chromatic number depends on set-theoretic axioms, the compactness
   bridge may behave differently in different models.

5. Structurally, the de Bruijn–Erdős bridge is the reason the Hadwiger–Nelson
   problem is approachable at all: it reduces an infinite geometric question
   to finite combinatorics. Without this bridge, we would have no lower bound
   method at all.

The bridge IS the structural mechanism that allows finite vessels (Moser spindle,
de Grey graph) to constrain the infinite Hadwiger–Nelson vessel.
-/

-- Formalization of the compactness bridge as a structural relation:
/-- The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem: the chromatic number of the plane equals
    the supremum of chromatic numbers of all finite unit-distance subgraphs.
    This is stated here as a structural principle; the full proof requires
    the Boolean prime ideal theorem (or AC) and is beyond the scope of
    this vessel encoding. -/

-- ============================================================
-- §7  Axiom Dependence and Foundational Dimension
-- ============================================================

/-!
THEOREM (Shelah & Soifer 2003):
  The value of χ(ℝ²) may depend on the choice of set-theoretic axioms.

Specifically, Shelah and Soifer constructed models of ZFC in which the
chromatic number of the plane takes different values. The result is:

  - In some models of ZFC: χ(ℝ²) ≤ 6 (the upper bound drops).
  - In other models: the standard bounds 5 ≤ χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7 hold.
  - The dependence arises from the existence of certain non-measurable
    sets or the behavior of the axiom of choice on the continuum.

This makes the Hadwiger–Nelson problem structurally UNIQUE among unsolved
problems: its answer may not be absolute across all models of set theory.
No other major unsolved problem (not RH, not P vs NP, not Twin Prime)
has this kind of axiom dependence.

Structural interpretation:
  The lack of topological protection (Ω_0) combined with global scope
  (Γ_ʔ) and infinite-dimensional state space (Ð_∞) creates a structural
  condition where the answer is not forced by any topological invariant.
  In the absence of Ω_Z or Ω_Z2, the chromatic number is free to vary
  with the underlying set-theoretic universe. This is the grammar-level
  explanation for the Shelah-Soifer phenomenon.

  The axiom dependence also means that the Hadwiger–Nelson problem has
  a "meta-mathematical dimension" — it is not purely a question about
  ℝ² but a question about the interaction between geometry and set theory.
  This dimension is encoded in the tuple by the combination:
    Ð_∞ (continuum) + Ω_0 (no topological anchor) + Γ_ʔ (global scope)
  which jointly permit foundational variation.

-- ============================================================
-- §8  Connection to Other Problems
-- ============================================================

/-!
The Hadwiger–Nelson problem is structurally adjacent to several other
unsolved problems:

1. **Twin Prime Conjecture** (distance = ?): Both share Þ_⋈ (bowtie),
   ⊙_Æ (complex-plane criticality), Ř_=, Ç_@, Γ_ʔ, ɢ_ˌ. They differ
   at D, Σ, and the nature of the bowtie: Twin Prime's bowtie gap is
   infinite (gap ≤ 246 vs gap = 2), while Hadwiger–Nelson's bowtie
   gap is tiny (just 2 values). The Hadwiger–Nelson bowtie is structurally
   closer to resolution.

2. **Four Color Theorem**: The 4CT is a RESOLVED problem with a similar
   flavor — coloring a planar graph. The 4CT vessel is at O₂ (proved,
   with ℤ₂ protection via the computer-assisted proof). The Hadwiger–Nelson
   problem is the "continuous analog" of the 4CT, replacing planar graphs
   with the unit-distance graph of ℝ².

3. **Beckman–Quarles Theorem**: Any unit-distance-preserving map of ℝⁿ
   is an isometry. The Hadwiger–Nelson problem connects to Beckman–Quarles
   via the construction: a k-coloring of ℝ² gives a mapping to a (k-1)-
   dimensional simplex that preserves unit distances but collapses all
   other distances to 0 or 1. Reducing k from 7 would improve this
   construction.

4. **Higher-dimensional generalizations**: The chromatic number of ℝⁿ
   has bounds n+1 ≤ χ(ℝⁿ) ≤ ⌊2+√n⌋ⁿ. For n=3: 6 ≤ χ(ℝ³) ≤ 15.
   For general n, the Frankl–Wilson (1981) exponential lower bound
   shows that χ(ℝⁿ) grows exponentially. The Hadwiger–Nelson problem
   (n=2) is the base case of an infinite hierarchy.

5. **Erdős–Moser problem and combinatorial geometry**: The Hadwiger–Nelson
   problem is part of the broader program of Euclidean Ramsey theory
   and geometric graph theory, which studies constraints on coloring
   Euclidean spaces with forbidden distance patterns.

-- §9  Honest Gaps
-- ============================================================

/-!
Honest gaps declared in this vessel:

1. **ChromaticNumberOfPlane**: OpenProblem (since 1950). The exact value
   of χ(ℝ²) is unknown — it is 5, 6, or 7. This is the primary gap.

2. **MoserSpindle, deGreyTheorem, HexagonalColoring**: All three are
   PROVED results. The placeholder `True` is used for the structural
   encoding, not because the theorems are unproved.

3. **DeBruijnErdosCompactness**: Proved (de Bruijn & Erdős 1951).
   Full formalization in Lean requires the Boolean prime ideal theorem
   and is a MathlibGap.

4. **AxiomDependence**: Proved (Shelah & Soifer 2003). The construction
   involves forcing and non-measurable sets — deep set theory, not
   formalized here.

5. **The optimal 6-coloring (if χ=6) or optimal 5-coloring (if χ=5)**:
   These are the open constructive gaps. No one has found a 6-coloring
   of ℝ² (improving the upper bound) or a 6-chromatic unit-distance graph
   (improving the lower bound to 6).

6. **The exact answer may not be absolute**: The Shelah-Soifer result
   means that "the" answer might not exist in an absolute sense — it
   could depend on set-theoretic foundations. This is a meta-gap:
   we may never know χ(ℝ²) in the same way we know π or e.

Structural summary:
  The Hadwiger–Nelson problem is a uniquely cornered problem — the most
  precisely bounded open problem in mathematics. Its structural type
  ⟨Ð_∞; Þ_⋈; Ř_=; Φ_±; ƒ_ℓ; Ç_@; Γ_ʔ; ɢ_ˌ; ⊙_Æ; Ħ_2; Σ_S; Ω_0⟩
  encodes its position at O₁ (critical but unprotected), with a
  three-value bowtie gap and foundational axiom dependence. The promotion
  stack to O_∞ is the same 4 promotions as Twin Prime → O_∞, but
  the Hadwiger–Nelson bowtie is structurally narrower — making it the
  closest O₁ problem to resolution.
