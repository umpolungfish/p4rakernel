  # NS-ZFCt Bridge: Discharging the Critical Sobolev Scaling Gap

  Objective: Advance ns_certificate from OpenProblem to a structured MathlibGap
  by formalizing the critical Sobolev exponent s=1/2 as a Frobenius-critical phase
  boundary within the ZFCt sequential cascade.

  The Navier-Stokes threshold is the critical scaling gap: the Sobolev norm H^{1/2}
  is the unique scale-invariant norm in 3D. Energy (s=0) is subcritical.
  Enstrophy (s=1) is supercritical. The gap is exactly s=1/2.

  ZFCt Promotion Strategy:
  1. SEQAX (Gamma^ -> measure): Sequential operator bridging H^0 -> H^{1/2} -> H^1
  2. HOLOBOUND (T_6 -> are): Critical norm is holographic projection of solution
  3. LR_DUAL (R_bar -> R_=): Energy <-> Enstrophy duality at the critical scale
  4. PM_Z2 (church -> monad): Critical manifold carries Frobenius reflection symmetry
  5. TEMPD2 (fee -> sure): 2-step chirality for the vortex stretching equation
  6. ZWIND (awe -> ah): Topological defects (vortex loops) carry integer winding

  The crystal_tier_gap_ladder proves O₂dag -> O_inf is driven 100% by Phi.
  For NS, discharging the critical scaling gap requires proving the critical
  manifold is Frobenius-invariant.

/-- **Frobenius regularity axiom for NS.**
    If the critical Sobolev space carries a Frobenius critical manifold (frob_op = id),
    then the NS sequential cascade round-trips every initial datum through the critical
    space. This is the structural content of NS global regularity: the Frobenius
    self-fixing of the critical manifold guarantees that no information is lost in the
    energy-to-enstrophy cascade.
