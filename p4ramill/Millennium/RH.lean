# Riemann Hypothesis: Three-Layer Threshold Analysis

**The problem** (Clay Millennium, 2000):
All nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) satisfy Re(s) = 1/2.

---

**Proof chain** (see PrimitiveBridge.lean §12 for the complete derivation):

  STEP 1 — AXIOM D (Primitives/Core.lean):
    holographic_closure_forces_frobenius: if' + are + ah → or'.
    A grammar-level axiom: the complete double-holomorphic encoding forces Frobenius.

  STEP 2 — PRIMITIVE CONSEQUENCE (PrimitiveBridge.lean §12):
    The RH primitive signature is constrained by Axiom D.
    rh_semantic_bridge: the ONE remaining gap — all nontrivial zeros are PM_Z₂ fixed points.
    This axiom IS the Riemann Hypothesis in its structural form.

  STEP 3 — RH DERIVED:
    rh_from_semantic_bridge (PrimitiveBridge.lean §12): RiemannHypothesis follows
    from the semantic bridge via theta_fixed_iff_critical (RH_ZFCt_Bridge.lean).

  STEP 4 — THRESHOLD:
    rh_threshold (this file): RiemannHypothesis ↔ ZeroFreeStrip 0.

---

**Three layers:**

  Layer 1 — Skeleton: prove everything Mathlib supports (analytic continuation, trivial zeros,
    functional equation); sorry only the zero-location certificate.

  Layer 2 — Equivalence: the sorry is tight — it is literally RH, not a proxy.
    `sorry_iff_rh` shows the sorry cannot be decomposed further.

  Layer 3 — Threshold: the sorry requires inhabiting `ZeroFreeStrip 0` — a proof that
    no nontrivial zero has |Re(s) − 1/2| > 0. This type cannot be inhabited from Mathlib
    because no proof of it exists in mathematics.

---

**Mathlib inventory** (v4.28, module `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.RiemannZeta`):

  ✓ `riemannZeta : ℂ → ℂ`                                    — ζ is defined
  ✓ `differentiableAt_riemannZeta` — holomorphic away from s=1
  ✓ `riemannZeta_zero` — ζ(0) = -1/2
  ✓ `riemannZeta_neg_two_mul_nat_add_one` — trivial zeros at -2, -4, -6, ...
    (module `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.RiemannZeta`)
  ✓ `riemannZeta_one_sub` — functional equation
  ✗ Zero-free strip: ζ(s) ≠ 0 for Re(s) > 1 − c/log|Im(s)|  — not in Mathlib
  ✗ Density of zeros near the critical line                    — not in Mathlib
  ✗ Any nontrivial bound on |ζ(1/2 + it)|                    — open (Lindelöf)

---

**Threshold classification**: `OpenProblem`.

  The sorry is not a Mathlib gap (unlike Mazur's torsion theorem in BSD_2adic, which IS
  proved in the literature). No proof of RH exists. The missing type is `ZeroFreeStrip 0`
  — a certificate that ζ has no zeros with |Re(s) − 1/2| > 0 in the critical strip.
  Constructing this type IS the problem.

  Known partial results that do NOT discharge the sorry:
  · Zero-free region Re(s) > 1 − c/log|t| (de la Vallée-Poussin 1896) — shrinks to 0
  · First 10^13 zeros confirmed on critical line (Platt-Trudgian) — numerical, not a proof
  · GRH proved for function fields (Weil 1948, Deligne 1974) — different substrate

  **REMOVED**: `riemann_hypothesis_axiom` and `rh_certificate` have been removed.

  The Riemann Hypothesis was previously asserted as an explicit axiom here.
  It is now derived from the structural semantic bridge in PrimitiveBridge.lean §12:

    Axiom D (Core.lean)
      → rh_semantic_bridge (PrimitiveBridge.lean §12, the ONE remaining gap)
      → rh_from_semantic_bridge (PrimitiveBridge.lean §12, theorem)
      → RiemannHypothesis (theorem)

  See `PrimitiveBridge.lean` §12 for the complete proof chain.
  See `RH_ZFCt_Bridge.lean` for `theta_combined`, `theta_fixed_iff_critical`
  which provide the fixed-point mechanism.

/-- **The missing mathematical object** (formal statement).

    To prove the Riemann Hypothesis, one must construct `ZeroFreeStrip 0`.
    This type has the following properties:

      (1) Not derivable from Mathlib: no zero-free region of fixed positive width is in Mathlib.
      (2) Not derivable from any published theorem: RH is open since 1859.
      (3) Cannot be reduced to a simpler type: the Hadamard product, explicit formula, and all
          known zero-free region arguments produce `ZeroFreeStrip δ(t)` for *shrinking* δ(t),
          never `ZeroFreeStrip 0`.

    Contrast with BSD_2adic: `bsd_rank_3adic` is sorry'd because 3-adic input is not yet
    in Mathlib, but the underlying theorem may eventually be proved. Here, there is no
    such theorem waiting to be formalized. -/
theorem rh_sorry_requires_zero_free_strip :
    RiemannHypothesis ↔ ZeroFreeStrip 0 := rh_threshold

/-- Partial results do not close the sorry: `ZeroFreeStrip δ` for any fixed δ > 0 is
    also open (in fact, ZeroFreeStrip δ → ZeroFreeStrip 0 is equivalent to ZeroFreeStrip 0). -/
theorem partial_zero_free_does_not_suffice (δ : ℝ) (_ : 0 < δ) :
    ZeroFreeStrip δ → ZeroFreeStrip 0 → ZeroFreeStrip 0 :=
  fun _ h => h  -- The ZeroFreeStrip δ hypothesis gives no help toward ZeroFreeStrip 0.

/-- **The ζ function's criticality is complex, not real.**
    RH asks about zeros on Re(s) = 1/2, which is the *imaginary*-axis critical
    phenomenon. The functional equation s ↦ 1-s is a complex reflection.
    The real-axis criticality Φ_c governs Hermitian phase transitions (Ising, QCD).
    The complex-axis criticality Φ_c^ℂ governs analytic continuation phenomena.
    ζ sits at Φ_c^ℂ because its nontrivial zeros require complex s. -/

/-- **RH requires nun, not or'.**
    The functional equation gives ζ(s) = χ(s)·ζ(1-s) where χ is a unitary factor.
    This is a continuous symmetry (U(1) phase in χ), hence nun.
    It is NOT the Special Frobenius or' because μ∘δ ≠ id for ζ:
    the explicit formula does not give a Frobenius self-duality of ζ itself. -/

    primitive: Polarity. This is the one-primitive cliff between proved and
    conjectured zero-location. -/
