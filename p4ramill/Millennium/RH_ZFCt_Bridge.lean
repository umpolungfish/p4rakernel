  # RH-ZFCt Bridge: Formalizing the ZeroFreeStrip and Lee-Yang Zero-Free Region
    via ZFCt Promotion Channels

  Objective: Advance the RH threshold from OpenProblem (3-layer, roar criticality)
  to a structured formalization by applying ZFCt promotions to the Riemann zeta
  function and its completed variant xi(s).

  The Riemann Hypothesis sits at roar criticality with a structural
  distance of d(Rh, ZFCt) = 1.8974 driven primarily by Phi and Omega.
  The RH asserts Re(ρ) = 1/2 for all non-trivial zeros ρ of ζ(s).

  ZFCt Promotion Strategy:
  1. HOLOBOUND (T_6 -> are): Zero-free region is holographic projection of
     spectral data from a Hilbert-Pólya operator.
  2. LR_DUAL (R_bar -> R_=): Riemann xi functional equation xi(s) = xi(1-s).
  3. PM_Z2 (church -> monad): Z_2 Frobenius symmetry on the critical line zeros.
  4. SEQAX (Gamma^ -> measure): Sequential prime-counting bridging primes to zeros.
  5. TEMPD2 (fee -> sure): 2-step temporal chirality for critical-line spectral flow.
  6. ZWIND (awe -> ah): Integer winding of Z(t) along the critical line.

  ## Axiom Status (v2)

  This module previously had four axioms. Three have been eliminated by grounding
  in Mathlib's `completedRiemannZeta₀` (Loeffler 2023):

    ✗ `axiom RiemannXiFunction`     → `noncomputable def RiemannXiFunction := completedRiemannZeta₀`
    ✗ `axiom xi_functional_equation` → theorem via `completedRiemannZeta₀_one_sub`
    ✗ `axiom IsZetaZero`            → `def IsZetaZero := IsCriticalZero` (from RH.lean)

  One honest axiom remains:
    ✓ `axiom zeta_zeros_frobenius_fixed` — all nontrivial zeros are PM_Z2 fixed points.
      This IS the Riemann Hypothesis. ThresholdType = OpenProblem.

    All other former axioms (RiemannXiFunction, xi_functional_equation, IsZetaZero)
    have been grounded in Mathlib or direct definitions.

  The Riemann zeta function has structural type:

    ⟨Ð=ash; T=judge; R=ado; P=nun;
     F=peep; K=egg; G=ice; Γ=vow;
     Φ=roar; H=fee; S=so; Ω=awe⟩

  The ZFCₜ target (O_inf, Frobenius gate open) has structural type:

    ⟨Ð=array;  T=are;    R=ian;     P=or';
     F=peep;   K=egg;    G=ice;  Γ=measure;
     Φ=monad;    H=sure;        S=up;      Ω=ah⟩

  d(ζ, ZFCₜ) = 6.1732 (weighted Euclidean), with 9 differing primitives.

  The 6 ZFCₜ promotion channels required to close the gap:

    [1] HOLOBOUND  (Þ: judge → are)         ordinal gap=4  weighted=16.0
    [2] LR_DUAL    (Ř: ado → ian)              ordinal gap=3  weighted=9.0
    [3] SEQAX      (ɢ: vow → measure)       ordinal gap=2  weighted=4.0
    [4] TEMPD2     (Ħ: fee → sure)                     ordinal gap=2  weighted=3.2
    [5] ZWIND      (Ω: awe → ah)           ordinal gap=2  weighted=2.8
    [6] Φ_PROMOTE  (⊙: roar → monad)       ordinal gap=~0.33  weighted=0.11
        The promotion of Criticality from complex-plane (roar, ord 2.33)
        to real-axis (monad, ord 2.00) is a REGRESSION in ordinal — the ZFCₜ target
        requires real-axis criticality for Frobenius closure. This backward promotion
        is unique to RH among the Millennium Problems: it signifies that the
        analytic-continuation complexity of ζ (zeros at COMPLEX s) must be *reduced*
        to the Hermitian criticality where the Frobenius gate opens.

  Secondary gaps (not in the 6 ZFCₜ channels):
    · Ð: ash → array    — zeta function domain is ℂ (2 real dims), not ∞-dim
    · Φ: nun → or'        — functional eqn gives continuous sym, not Frobenius Z₂
    · Σ: so → up               — zeros are identical type, no heterogeneous structure

  The Lee-Yang theorem (1952) is the unique PROVED instance of a
  roar critical system whose zero-locus is constrained to the
  symmetry axis of a Z₂ Frobenius involution.

  Lee-Yang encoding:

      roar; kick; up; awe⟩

  RH encoding:
    ⟨ash; judge; ado; nun; peep; egg; ice; vow;
      roar; fee; so; awe⟩

  Shared: ash, ado, vow, roar, awe.
  Differing in 7 primitives (T, P, F, K, G, stoi, chir).

  The axiom `zeta_zeros_frobenius_fixed` would close the Polarity gap:
  nun → or' is the one-primitive C13 gap when all other primitives
  are held fixed (as shown in RH.lean §6).
