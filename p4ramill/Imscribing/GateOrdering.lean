-- THE GATE ORDERING 4 < 9 < 12
-- ============================================================
-- The Alchemical Theory of Mathematics rests on a single ordered claim:
-- the twelve structural invariants must be fixed in a definite order, forced
-- by three categorical gates,
--
--   G1  stage 4   Conjunction   Parity        special Frobenius  μ∘δ = id
--   G2  stage 9   Fermentation  Criticality   traced monoidal    the loop closes
--   G3  stage 12  Projection    Protection    idempotent terminal  the seal
--
-- This file proves the ordering is real and STRICT, not a relabeling. The
-- operad layers form a four-step tower; each higher layer provably requires the
-- structure the previous one produced, and each inclusion is proper (witnessed
-- by an explicit tuple inhabiting one layer but not the next).
--
-- The trace of G2 is built on the polarization Frobenius pair (δ_C, μ_C) from
-- Imscribing/Frobenius.lean. The theorem mu_delta_C_id_on_special is the hinge:
-- the trace closes EXACTLY on the special class pol = or' ∧ crit = monad, so a
-- closing trace forces the Frobenius value — that is 4 < 9 as a theorem.

-- ============================================================
-- Stages 5 (Putrefaction, F), 6 (Congelation, K), 7 (Cibation, G) and
-- 8 (Sublimation, Γ) carry no gate. Each is a single-axis projection toward the
-- Stone value on an axis that no unlock predicate reads. Two facts make
-- "order-free" precise and distinguish these stages from the gates:
--   (i)  the four projections pairwise COMMUTE (updates on disjoint axes);
--   (ii) each is INERT on every unlock predicate (it neither opens nor closes a
--        gate), so it may be interleaved anywhere in the sequence.
-- The contrast lemma `parity_stage_couples` shows a gate stage is NOT inert:
-- setting the parity axis can flip `unlockTraced` from false to true. That
-- coupling is exactly why 4 < 9 < 12 is forced while 5–8 float.
