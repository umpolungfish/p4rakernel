/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: search progression
--   The forward movement through the search space toward a target.
-- AREV: backtracking
--   The reversal of search steps when a path is exhausted or invalid.
-- CLINK: step composition
--   The chaining of individual search operations into a continuous path.
-- ENGAGR: stochastic noise
--   The simultaneous presence of signal and noise in a lossy classical system.
-- EVALF: fidelity loss
--   The detection of information loss exceeding the 'age' limit.
-- EVALT: fidelity match
--   The confirmation that the operation maintains the required classical fidelity.
-- FFUSE: fidelity resolution
--   The reconstitution of the search state after the fidelity check.
-- FSPLIT: fidelity comparison
--   The branching of the search based on whether the current fidelity meets the 'age' threshold.
-- IFIX: search log
--   The permanent record of the search path and its fidelity metrics.
-- IMSCRIB: fidelity self-recognition
--   The system identifying its own state as 'age' (classical lossy).
-- TANCH: search termination
--   The final boundary where the search concludes and the result is returned.
-- VINIT: uninitialized search space
--   The state before any search parameters or fidelity constraints are defined.
