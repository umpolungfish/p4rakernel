-- AFWD: forward step
--   a single transition forward in time without memory of the previous state
-- AREV: backward step
--   a single transition backward in time that is indistinguishable from the forward step
-- CLINK: state transition
--   the chaining of instantaneous states into a sequence
-- ENGAGR: temporal superposition
--   the state where forward and backward directions are held as identical
-- EVALF: chiral drift
--   the detection of a memory-induced bias in the transition
-- EVALT: temporal parity
--   the confirmation that the forward path maintains symmetry
-- FFUSE: vector collapse
--   the reunification of directions into a single achiral point
-- FSPLIT: directionality fork
--   the branching of a path into potential forward and backward vectors
-- IFIX: erasure record
--   the permanent log of the deletion of temporal history
-- IMSCRIB: instantaneous identity
--   the recognition of the current state as independent of its history
-- TANCH: achiral closure
--   the boundary that prevents the accumulation of temporal memory
-- VINIT: pre-temporal state
--   the state before any temporal orientation or chiral bias is introduced
