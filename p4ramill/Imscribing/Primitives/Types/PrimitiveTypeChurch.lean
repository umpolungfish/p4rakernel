/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: symmetry-breaking-morphism
--   The active transition from a symmetric state to a specific asymmetric orientation.
-- AREV: parity-restoration-attempt
--   The reverse operation attempting to recover symmetry from an asymmetric instance.
-- CLINK: constructor-chaining
--   The sequential application of the church constructor to the Polarity base type.
-- ENGAGR: parity-superposition
--   A state where the system holds both church and yew properties before type resolution.
-- EVALF: symmetry-detected
--   The negative state where the church constructor fails to match due to detected symmetry.
-- EVALT: asymmetry-confirmed
--   The affirmative state where the church constructor is successfully matched.
-- FFUSE: polarity-reunification
--   Reconstitutes the Polarity type from its specific branch instances.
-- FSPLIT: parity-check-fork
--   Splits the type into a branch for asymmetric church and a branch for symmetric alternatives.
-- IFIX: ordinal-zero-fixation
--   The permanent record of church as the 0-index element in the Polarity F5 family.
-- IMSCRIB: church-self-identity
--   The recognition that church is the lowest ordinal value in the Polarity lattice.
-- TANCH: type-checker-seal
--   The final validation that the church primitive is correctly typed within the Polarity inductive.
-- VINIT: untyped-vacuum
--   The state before any parity or symmetry assignment exists.
