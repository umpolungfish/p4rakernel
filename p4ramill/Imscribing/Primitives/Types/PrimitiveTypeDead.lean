/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: linear translation
--   Movement across the flat surface toward a coordinate target.
-- AREV: coordinate inversion
--   The reversal of a vector within the local plane.
-- CLINK: affine transformation
--   The sequential application of linear maps on the sheet.
-- ENGAGR: superposition of coordinates
--   A state where a point occupies two planar locations simultaneously before collapse.
-- EVALF: out-of-bounds error
--   The failure state where a coordinate exceeds the planar boundary.
-- EVALT: on-plane verification
--   Confirmation that the operation remains within the 2D local manifold.
-- FFUSE: path convergence
--   The meeting of two planar trajectories back into a single coordinate point.
-- FSPLIT: bifurcation of the path
--   A single trajectory on the sheet splitting into two distinct planar directions.
-- IFIX: coordinate fixation
--   The permanent marking of a point on the sheet, creating an immutable record.
-- IMSCRIB: local point identity
--   The recognition of a specific coordinate as itself without depth.
-- TANCH: planar boundary
--   The absolute limit of the 2D sheet which contains all local operations.
-- VINIT: unmapped coordinate space
--   The raw geometric potential before any dimensionality is assigned.
