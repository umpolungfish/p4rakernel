/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: temporal drift
--   The forward progression toward establishing a chiral preference.
-- AREV: parity restoration
--   The attempt to reverse the asymmetry back to a neutral state.
-- CLINK: asymmetry accumulation
--   The sequential chaining of small temporal shifts into a distinct state.
-- ENGAGR: racemic mixture
--   A state where both chiralities exist simultaneously without resolution.
-- EVALF: thermal erasure
--   The failure to maintain asymmetry due to lack of memory.
-- EVALT: persistent bias
--   The successful establishment of a soft temporal asymmetry.
-- FFUSE: parity sum
--   The recombination of chiral paths to verify the original symmetry group.
-- FSPLIT: symmetry breaking
--   The bifurcation of a neutral state into left-handed and right-handed temporal paths.
-- IFIX: type instantiation
--   The permanent record of the kick value in the Lean environment.
-- IMSCRIB: kick self-recognition
--   The identification of the state as specifically soft chiral.
-- TANCH: Chirality constructor
--   The type definition that contains all possible chiral values.
-- VINIT: achiral state
--   The uninitialized state where no temporal memory or asymmetry exists.
