/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: requirement addition
--   The forward movement of adding a new condition to the conjunctive set.
-- AREV: constraint relaxation
--   The removal or descent from a specific requirement back toward a broader state.
-- CLINK: logical intersection
--   The sequential chaining of multiple conditions into a single conjunctive requirement.
-- ENGAGR: quantum superposition of constraints
--   A state where a condition is both required and not yet determined.
-- EVALF: violation
--   The state where a condition fails to be met.
-- EVALT: satisfaction
--   The state where a condition is successfully met.
-- FFUSE: conjunctive synthesis
--   The reconstitution of the original state only if all parallel conditions are met.
-- FSPLIT: parallel condition evaluation
--   The branching of a single state into multiple conditions that must all be satisfied.
-- IFIX: vow fixation
--   The permanent recording of the conjunctive interaction in the crystal.
-- IMSCRIB: self-consistency check
--   The identity operation where a requirement is verified against itself.
-- TANCH: vow primitive
--   The terminal definition of the conjunctive interaction mode within the grammar.
-- VINIT: unconstrained state
--   The initial state before any conjunctive requirements are imposed.
