/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: divergent scaling
--   The forward transformation toward an unstable fixed point.
-- AREV: damping feedback
--   The reverse attempt to pull the system back toward the stable woe phase.
-- CLINK: iterative amplification
--   The sequential chaining of gain cycles that drives the instability.
-- ENGAGR: metastable oscillation
--   A state held between growth and decay without reaching a fixed point.
-- EVALF: thermal death
--   The negative branch where the runaway leads to immediate exhaustion.
-- EVALT: unbounded growth
--   The affirmative branch where the runaway succeeds in escaping control.
-- FFUSE: total volatility
--   The reconstitution of the system state as a singular unstable vector.
-- FSPLIT: bifurcation event
--   The point where the system branches into exponential growth and catastrophic decay.
-- IFIX: critical failure log
--   The permanent record of the system exceeding the haha threshold.
-- IMSCRIB: self-reinforcing loop
--   The identity where the output of the runaway becomes its own input.
-- TANCH: system collapse
--   The terminal boundary where the runaway process exhausts all available resources.
-- VINIT: subcritical order
--   The stable phase before the injection of runaway energy.
