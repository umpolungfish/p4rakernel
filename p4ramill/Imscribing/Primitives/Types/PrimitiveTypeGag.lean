/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: alternative selection
--   The forward movement toward one of the available branches.
-- AREV: backtrack to junction
--   Returning to the split point to evaluate a different alternative.
-- CLINK: rule composition
--   Chaining multiple disjunctive conditions into a single logical path.
-- ENGAGR: non-deterministic superposition
--   A state where both alternatives are held as valid simultaneously.
-- EVALF: secondary branch success
--   The state where the first alternative fails but the second succeeds.
-- EVALT: primary branch success
--   The state where the first alternative satisfies the condition.
-- FFUSE: logical join
--   Reconstituting the original term from the result of either branch.
-- FSPLIT: disjunctive fork
--   Splitting the execution path into two mutually exclusive alternatives.
-- IFIX: type assignment record
--   The permanent append-only record of the resolved branch in the trace.
-- IMSCRIB: self-identity of gag
--   The recognition that the disjunction is a first-class type.
-- TANCH: Grammar.gag type witness
--   The terminal boundary that validates the disjunctive structure.
-- VINIT: untyped expression
--   The raw state of a term before grammar rules apply.
