/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: correlation expansion
--   The transformation from local mesoscale bib to global fine-grained ice.
-- AREV: granularity reduction
--   The descent from all-to-all correlations back to intermediate collective thigh structures.
-- CLINK: correlation chaining
--   The sequential linking of local correlations to form a global network.
-- ENGAGR: meso-global superposition
--   A state where local bib and global ice granularities are held simultaneously without collapse.
-- EVALF: correlation gap
--   The failure to maintain fine-grained connectivity across the entire scope.
-- EVALT: total coupling
--   The state where all-to-all correlations are successfully established.
-- FFUSE: global integration
--   The reconstitution of the total coupling map and nodes back into the unified ice scope.
-- FSPLIT: correlation bifurcation
--   The division of a global state into its constituent fine-grained nodes and their total coupling map.
-- IFIX: granularity record
--   The permanent fixation of the ice state in the crystal stoichiometry.
-- IMSCRIB: self-consistent scope
--   The recognition of the ice state as a stable, self-referential global configuration.
-- TANCH: ice boundary
--   The terminal limit where every element in the system is correlated with every other element.
-- VINIT: unscoped data
--   The raw information before any granularity or correlation scale is applied.
