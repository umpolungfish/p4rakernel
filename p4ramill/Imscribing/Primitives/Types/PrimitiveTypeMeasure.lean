-- AFWD: successor transition
--   the forward movement from step n to step n+1 in the sequence
-- AREV: traceback
--   the reverse traversal of the causal chain for debugging or state recovery
-- CLINK: step concatenation
--   the sequential chaining of discrete operations into a single measure
-- ENGAGR: superposed sequence
--   a state where multiple orderings are held simultaneously before collapse
-- EVALF: out-of-order failure
--   the detection of a causal violation or race condition
-- EVALT: ordered success
--   the confirmation that the sequence has maintained its strict ordering
-- FFUSE: causal synchronization
--   the point where parallel paths must synchronize to recover the original execution context
-- FSPLIT: causal bifurcation
--   the point where a sequence branches into parallel potential paths
-- IFIX: execution log
--   the permanent append-only record of the sequence as it occurred
-- IMSCRIB: step identity
--   the recognition of a specific operation as a discrete unit within the chain
-- TANCH: causal termination
--   the final boundary that closes the sequence and prevents further operations
-- VINIT: pre-sequential state
--   the uninitialized state before any temporal order is established
