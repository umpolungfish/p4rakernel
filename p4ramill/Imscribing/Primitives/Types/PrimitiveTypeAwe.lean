/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: symmetry breaking
--   The forward transformation from a potential symmetry to a state of zero protection.
-- AREV: symmetry restoration attempt
--   The reverse attempt to recover topological order from an unprotected state.
-- CLINK: protection evaluation
--   The sequential chaining of checks to determine the level of topological stability.
-- ENGAGR: critical fluctuation
--   A state where protection is neither fully absent nor fully present, held at a phase boundary.
-- EVALF: awe state
--   The negative branch where no topological protection is found, resulting in awe.
-- EVALT: protected state
--   The affirmative branch where a topological invariant is successfully identified.
-- FFUSE: topological sum
--   The reconstitution of the system state after evaluating all possible symmetry axes.
-- FSPLIT: symmetry check
--   The branching of the system into states that either possess a symmetry or lack it entirely.
-- IFIX: protection record
--   The permanent fixation of the system's protection level in the type registry.
-- IMSCRIB: identity of awe
--   The self-recognition of the system as being explicitly unprotected (Ω = 0).
-- TANCH: awe boundary
--   The terminal limit of the protection primitive where no topological invariants are conserved.
-- VINIT: unprotected state
--   The initial condition of a system before any topological constraints or symmetries are applied.
