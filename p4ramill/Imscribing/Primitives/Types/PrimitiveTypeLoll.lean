/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: thermal activation
--   The forward movement toward overcoming the moderate threshold.
-- AREV: viscous relaxation
--   The return to a state of rest below the activation barrier.
-- CLINK: barrier coupling
--   The sequential chaining of small fluctuations into a crossing event.
-- ENGAGR: metastable state
--   The simultaneous presence of both potential and kinetic energy at the barrier peak.
-- EVALF: activation failure
--   The negative state where the system remains below the threshold.
-- EVALT: activation success
--   The affirmative state where the kinetic barrier is surpassed.
-- FFUSE: kinetic equilibrium
--   The reconstitution of the total probability density from both branches.
-- FSPLIT: threshold bifurcation
--   The split between successful barrier crossing and reflection.
-- IFIX: state transition log
--   The permanent record of a successful kinetic event.
-- IMSCRIB: loll identity
--   The self-recognition of the state as moderately constrained but not trapped.
-- TANCH: loll boundary
--   The specific ordinal rank 1 within the F5 kinetic family.
-- VINIT: potential energy surface
--   The unperturbed state before any kinetic character is assigned.
