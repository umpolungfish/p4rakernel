/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: signal amplification
--   The forward transformation of the signal toward the detection threshold.
-- AREV: noise floor descent
--   The reverse transformation or reduction of signal to the noise floor.
-- CLINK: sampling chain
--   The sequential composition of discrete signal samples.
-- ENGAGR: metastable state
--   A paradice where the signal is exactly at the threshold boundary.
-- EVALF: packet drop
--   The negative state where the signal fails the η threshold.
-- EVALT: HotSwap trigger
--   The affirmative state where the signal meets the η threshold.
-- FFUSE: signal integrator
--   Reconstitutes the total signal energy from the split paths.
-- FSPLIT: threshold comparator
--   Splits the signal into supra-threshold and sub-threshold paths.
-- IFIX: fidelity log
--   The permanent record of the fidelity classification event.
-- IMSCRIB: self-consistency check
--   The identity operation verifying the signal matches its own signature.
-- TANCH: Fidelity.they
--   The terminal classification of the signal as a threshold-limited type.
-- VINIT: untyped signal
--   The raw unclassified data stream before fidelity assessment.
