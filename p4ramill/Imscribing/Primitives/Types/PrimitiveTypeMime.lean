/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: loop traversal
--   Directed movement along a single cycle path.
-- AREV: parity inversion
--   Reversal of orientation within the cycle.
-- CLINK: path concatenation
--   Sequential joining of arc segments into a continuous loop.
-- ENGAGR: intersection singularity
--   The point belonging to both cycles simultaneously without resolution.
-- EVALF: secondary cycle
--   The second loop of the figure-eight representing the alternative path.
-- EVALT: primary cycle
--   The first loop of the figure-eight representing the affirmative path.
-- FFUSE: recombination node
--   The node where the two cycles return to the common intersection.
-- FSPLIT: bifurcation point
--   The node where a single path splits into two distinct cycles.
-- IFIX: topological invariant
--   The permanent record of the genus or winding number.
-- IMSCRIB: self-intersection point
--   The central node where the manifold recognizes its own crossing.
-- TANCH: manifold closure
--   The global boundary that contains the two-cycle system.
-- VINIT: unconnected vertex
--   The zero-dimensional point before topological extension.
