-- AFWD: aggregation

--   the simultaneous presence of local and global features without resolution
-- EVALF: scale mismatch
--   the failure to find patterns at the intermediate collective level
-- EVALT: collective coherence
--   the successful identification of intermediate-range patterns
-- FFUSE: collective synthesis
--   the reconstitution of the intermediate scale from its constituent correlation paths

--   the branching of data into short-range and long-range correlation paths
-- IFIX: type assignment
--   the permanent record of the thigh granularity value in the crystal
-- IMSCRIB: thigh identity
--   the self-recognition of the intermediate collective state as a distinct type
