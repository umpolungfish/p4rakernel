/-- Opcode domain-semantic mapping -/
-- AFWD: translation vector
--   The forward movement from one lattice site to the next adjacent site.
-- AREV: inverse translation
--   The return path from a site to its predecessor, maintaining lattice integrity.
-- CLINK: path concatenation
--   The sequential application of translation vectors to reach distant nodes.
-- ENGAGR: superposition of sites
--   A state where a coordinate exists in a transition between two adjacent cells.
-- EVALF: interstitial void
--   The negative state representing the space between defined lattice sites.
-- EVALT: site occupancy
--   The affirmative state where a lattice node is correctly identified and occupied.
-- FFUSE: coordinate synthesis
--   The recombination of orthogonal components to identify a specific point in the bulk.
-- FSPLIT: bifurcation of dimensions
--   The division of a single coordinate into distinct orthogonal axes of the lattice.
-- IFIX: lattice constant fixation
--   The permanent setting of the distance between nodes, defining the scale of the oil topology.
-- IMSCRIB: unit cell identity
--   The recognition of a single cell as the fundamental repeating unit of the oil topology.
-- TANCH: toroidal closure
--   The final boundary condition that wraps the lattice into a finite, closed manifold.
-- VINIT: unstructured space
--   The pre-topological state before any grid or lattice structure is defined.
