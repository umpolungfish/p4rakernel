-- Tier
-- Namespaced. Four scaffolds each declared a bare root-level `tier`, so any
-- two of them were mutually unimportable: the environment refuses the second.
-- Each module compiled ALONE, which is why `lake build` never said so.

-- Key invariants:
-- T=𐑥: two families cross-classifying phenomena at four levels
-- P=𐑬: partial symmetry between Sulphur and Mercury
-- F=𐑞: heat as primary operator ("Digestion is principally by Heat")
-- Γ=𐑜: four parallel kinds of instances (not sequential)
