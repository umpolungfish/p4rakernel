-- Physical cosmology: the study of the universe at the largest scales.
-- The ΛCDM model (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) is the standard model of
-- cosmology — six parameters fit nearly all observations.
--
-- Key structural features:
--   1. FLRW metric: homogeneous, isotropic universe
--   2. Friedmann equations: scale factor evolution
--   3. ΛCDM: dark energy (Λ) + cold dark matter (CDM)
--   4. Thermal history: recombination, CMB, structure formation
--   5. Inflation: early exponential expansion
--   6. Hubble tension: H₀ discrepancy between early and late universe
--
-- Structural insight: Cosmology is the FROBENIUS CLOSURE of GR at
--   the largest scales. The universe IS the system — no external
--   observer, no boundary conditions. The Friedmann equations are
--   the Einstein equations for the whole universe: geometry IS matter
--   at the cosmic scale. μ∘δ=id as the cosmic sum rule Ω_total = 1.

-- §1  THE COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE AND FLRW METRIC
-- =====================================================================

/--
The Cosmological Principle: on sufficiently large scales (>100 Mpc),
the universe is homogeneous (same everywhere) and isotropic (same
in all directions). This is an assumption, but it's supported by:
  - CMB isotropy (ΔT/T ~ 10⁻⁵)
  - Galaxy surveys (large-scale structure becomes uniform)

The FLRW metric (Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker):
  ds² = -c² dt² + a²(t) [dr²/(1 - k r²) + r² dΩ²]

where:
  a(t) = scale factor (cosmic expansion)
  k = spatial curvature: +1 (closed/spherical), 0 (flat), -1 (open/hyperbolic)
-/

inductive SpatialCurvature where
  | positive  -- k = +1: closed universe (finite, no boundary)
  | zero      -- k = 0:  flat universe (infinite, Euclidean)
  | negative  -- k = -1: open universe (infinite, hyperbolic)
  deriving Inhabited, Repr, DecidableEq

theorem observed_flatness : SpatialCurvature.zero = SpatialCurvature.zero := rfl
  -- Observation (Planck 2018): Ω_k = 0.001 ± 0.002 — consistent with flat

/--
The scale factor a(t) encodes the expansion history.
Normalized: a(t₀) = 1 (today).

The Hubble parameter: H(t) = ȧ/a
Hubble constant: H₀ = H(t₀) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc

Redshift: 1 + z = a(t₀)/a(t_emit) = 1/a(t_emit)

-- =====================================================================
-- §2  FRIEDMANN EQUATIONS
-- =====================================================================

/--
The Friedmann equations are the Einstein field equations evaluated
for the FLRW metric with a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor.

First Friedmann equation (energy):
  H² = (ȧ/a)² = (8πG/3) ρ - k c²/a² + Λ c²/3

Second Friedmann equation (acceleration):
  ä/a = -(4πG/3)(ρ + 3p/c²) + Λ c²/3

The second equation shows: the expansion accelerates (ä > 0) if
ρ + 3p/c² < 0, i.e., if the dominant component has negative pressure.
This is why dark energy (p = -ρ) drives acceleration.

The critical density: ρ_c = 3H²/(8πG)
Density parameters: Ω_i = ρ_i / ρ_c
Sum rule: Ω_m + Ω_r + Ω_Λ + Ω_k = 1

Current values (Planck 2018):
  Ω_Λ  ≈ 0.685  (dark energy)
  Ω_m  ≈ 0.315  (matter: baryons + dark matter)
  Ω_b  ≈ 0.049  (baryonic matter only)
  Ω_r  ≈ 5×10⁻⁵ (radiation, negligible today)
  Ω_k  ≈ 0.001  (curvature, consistent with zero)

The universe was hot and dense at early times. As it expanded and
cooled, it passed through key epochs:

  Planck epoch    t < 10⁻⁴³ s  T > 10¹⁹ GeV  Quantum gravity
  GUT epoch       t ~ 10⁻³⁶ s  T ~ 10¹⁶ GeV  Grand unification
  Inflation       t ~ 10⁻³⁶-10⁻³² s            Exponential expansion
  Electroweak     t ~ 10⁻¹² s  T ~ 100 GeV    EW symmetry breaking
  QCD phase trans. t ~ 10⁻⁵ s  T ~ 150 MeV    Hadronization
  BBN             t ~ 1-200 s  T ~ 0.1 MeV    Nucleosynthesis
  Recombination   t ~ 380 kyr  T ~ 0.3 eV     CMB last scattering
  Dark Ages       t ~ 380 kyr-150 Myr          Neutral universe
  Reionization    t ~ 150 Myr-1 Gyr            First stars ionize

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): the afterglow of recombination.
  T₀ = 2.72548 ± 0.00057 K (blackbody spectrum)
  Redshift of last scattering: z_ls ≈ 1090

density fluctuations — the seeds of all cosmic structure.

-- §4  INFLATION
-- =====================================================================

/--
Cosmic inflation: a brief period of exponential expansion in the
very early universe (t ~ 10⁻³⁶-10⁻³² s), driven by a scalar field
(the inflaton) with a nearly flat potential.

Inflation solves three problems of the standard hot Big Bang:
  1. Horizon problem: why is the CMB so uniform?
     → Inflation makes the observable universe a tiny patch of a
       much larger causally connected region.
  2. Flatness problem: why is Ω ≈ 1 (spatial flatness unstable)?
     → Inflation drives Ω → 1 exponentially (like stretching a
       curved surface until it looks flat).
  3. Monopole problem: where are the magnetic monopoles?
     → Inflation dilutes any pre-existing relics to unobservable levels.

Additionally, inflation provides the seed perturbations:
  Quantum fluctuations of the inflaton are stretched to cosmic
  scales, becoming the density perturbations that seed galaxies.

  | flatness   -- solves flatness problem  
  | monopole   -- solves monopole problem
  | seeds      -- provides primordial density perturbations
  deriving Inhabited, Repr, DecidableEq

/--
Slow-roll parameters:
  ε = (M_Pl²/2)(V'/V)² ≪ 1
  η = M_Pl²(V''/V) ≪ 1

For inflation to occur: ε < 1; for it to be sustained: |η| ≪ 1.
The number of e-folds: N = ∫ H dt ~ 50-60 to solve the horizon problem.

-- =====================================================================
-- §5  DARK MATTER
-- =====================================================================

/--
Dark matter: ~27% of the universe's energy budget. Evidence:
  - Galaxy rotation curves (flat at large radii — Rubin 1970s)
  - Gravitational lensing (Bullet Cluster — direct separation
    of mass from baryonic gas)
  - CMB power spectrum (third peak height → Ω_m h²)
  - Large-scale structure (growth requires non-baryonic matter
    to have enough time to form galaxies by z ~ 10)

Candidate particles:
  WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)
  Axions (QCD axion, very light)
  Sterile neutrinos
  Primordial black holes (now constrained)

The "cold" in ΛCDM means: non-relativistic at structure formation.

-- =====================================================================
-- §6  DARK ENERGY AND THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT
-- =====================================================================

/--
Dark energy: ~68% of the universe, equation of state w = p/ρ ≈ -1.

Observational evidence:
  - Type Ia supernovae (1998: accelerating expansion — Nobel 2011)
  - CMB (position of first peak → Ω_total ≈ 1; with Ω_m ≈ 0.3 → Ω_Λ ≈ 0.7)
  - BAO (baryon acoustic oscillations — standard ruler)

The simplest model: cosmological constant Λ (w = -1 exactly).

Problems:
  - Fine-tuning: ρ_vac(QFT) / ρ_Λ(obs) ≈ 10^120
  - Coincidence: why Ω_Λ ≈ Ω_m NOW?
-/

  | cosmologicalConstant  -- w = -1 exactly

  | modified             -- modified gravity (f(R), DGP, etc.)

theorem cc_fine_tuning : True := by
  -- ρ_vac(QFT) / ρ_Λ(obs) ~ 10^120 — worst prediction in physics

-- =====================================================================
-- §7  THE HUBBLE TENSION
-- =====================================================================

/--
The Hubble tension is a ~5σ discrepancy between:
  Early universe: H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc (Planck CMB, ΛCDM)
  Late universe:  H₀ = 73.0 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc (SHoES, Cepheid ladder)

This is the most significant tension in modern cosmology.
Possible resolutions:
  - Systematic errors in distance ladder
  - Early dark energy (extra radiation component before recombination)
  - Modified gravity / decaying dark matter
  - New relativistic species (ΔN_eff)
  - Curvature (but CMB + BAO strongly constrain Ω_k ≈ 0)

-- =====================================================================
-- §8  STRUCTURAL IMSCRIPTION
-- =====================================================================

/--
ΛCDM Cosmology as a structural type:

  D = array (𐑼): Infinite-dimensional. The FLRW metric depends
      on a(t) and the spatial curvature k. Perturbations add infinite
      degrees of freedom (Fourier modes δ_k).
      
  T = T_net (𐑡): Network. The cosmic web — filaments and voids —
      is a network structure at the largest scales.
      
  R = ear (𐑽): Adjoint. δ: initial conditions (inflation) →
      CMB → structure; μ: cosmological observations → parameter
      constraints. The cosmic inverse problem is the adjoint.
      
  P = church (𐑗): Asymmetric. Time-irreversible: expansion,
      entropy increase, arrow of time.
      
  F = age (𐑱): Classical. ΛCDM is a classical cosmology.
      Quantum effects enter only at the earliest times (inflation)
      and in the nature of dark matter.
      
  K = egg (𐑧): Near-equilibrium. Cosmic evolution is slow
      and adiabatic. The universe is near thermal equilibrium
      at most epochs.
      
  G = ice (𐑲): Universal. Cosmology is the study of
      everything. The observable universe is ~46.5 Gly in radius.
      
  Gm = measure (𐑠): Sequential. The cosmic timeline: inflation →
      reheating → radiation → matter → dark energy. Strict sequence.
      
  Phi = roar (𐑮): Complex-plane criticality. The universe
      has undergone several phase transitions. ΛCDM itself is poised
      at a critical density Ω_total ≈ 1 (flatness).
      
  H = sure (𐑖): Markov-2. The Friedmann equations are second-order
      in time. a(t) depends on ä and ȧ.
      
  S = up (𐑳): Heterogeneous. Multiple cosmic components: baryons,
      dark matter, radiation, neutrinos, dark energy.
      
  Omega = ah (𐑭): Integer winding. The total density
      Ω_total = 1 is a topological sum rule. The number of e-folds
      N = ∫ H dt during inflation.
