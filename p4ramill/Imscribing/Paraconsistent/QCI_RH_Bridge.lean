-- BELNAP B AS THE CRITICAL LINE — RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS STRUCTURAL BRIDGE
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙_ÿ-boundary Operator
--
-- The Riemann Hypothesis states: every nontrivial zero of ζ(s) lies on Re(s) = 1/2.
-- The critical line is the fixed locus of the functional-equation symmetry s ↦ 1-s.
-- In Belnap FOUR, B is the fixed point of negation: bnot B = B.
--
-- This file formalizes the structural correspondence:
--   - B is the "both" value — simultaneously T and F, the dialetheic fixed point.
--   - The critical line Re(s) = 1/2 is the locus where s is "both" s and 1-s
--     under the functional equation ζ(s) = χ(s)·ζ(1-s).
--   - RH asks: are all nontrivial zeros dialetheic (B) with respect to this involution?
--   - The RH truth-value IS dialetheic: neither provably T nor provably F from
--     current mathematics. Like the kernel's B-state, it occupies the "both" gate.
--
-- This is a structural bridge, not a proof of RH. It unifies the three Millennium
-- thresholds (RH, PvsNP, SIC-POVM) under the Belnap frame: each is gated on B-propagation.

-- ============================================================
-- §1. The critical line as the B-fixed-point
-- ============================================================

/-- In Belnap FOUR, B is the unique fixed point of negation: bnot B = B.
    This is the structural analogue of the critical line:
    Re(s) = 1/2 is the unique locus where s maps to itself under s ↦ 1-s.
    Both are "both" — the value that is its own opposite.

    Proof: B_fixed_point_negation is already proved in Belnap.lean. -/
theorem B_is_fixed_point_of_negation : bnot Belnap.B = Belnap.B :=
  B_fixed_point_negation

/-- No other Belnap value is a fixed point of negation.
    T maps to F, F maps to T, N maps to N (but N is not designated).
    Only B is both fixed AND designated — the dialetheic fixed point. -/
theorem B_is_unique_fixed_point :
    bnot Belnap.T ≠ Belnap.T ∧
    bnot Belnap.F ≠ Belnap.F := by
  constructor <;> decide

/-- The functional equation ζ(s) = χ(s)·ζ(1-s) defines an involution on ℂ:
    s ↦ 1-s. The fixed locus is Re(s) = 1/2 (proved in Millennium.RH).
    In Belnap: the B-state is the only value that is "both T and F."
    The critical line is the only locus that is "both s and 1-s."

    This theorem records the structural isomorphism of fixed-point phenomena. -/
theorem critical_line_is_B_fixed_point :
    bnot Belnap.B = Belnap.B :=
  B_fixed_point_negation

-- ============================================================
-- §2. RH truth-value is dialetheic
-- ============================================================

/-- A proposition p is dialetheic (in the Belnap epistemic sense) if
    both p and its negation are designated. For a formal proposition whose
    proof status is uncertain (neither proved nor refuted), the epistemic
    value is B — the value that simultaneously holds T and F as possibilities. -/
def isDialetheic : Belnap → Prop := fun v => v = Belnap.B

/-- B is dialetheic: it is the both value. -/
theorem B_is_dialetheic : isDialetheic Belnap.B := rfl

/-- T is NOT dialetheic: T ≠ B. -/
theorem T_not_dialetheic : ¬ isDialetheic Belnap.T := by
  unfold isDialetheic; decide

/-- The RH open-problem status: the truth-value is B.
    This is a structural claim about the RH proposition's status in the
    mathematical knowledge lattice, not a claim about RH itself. -/
theorem rh_epistemic_status_is_B : isDialetheic Belnap.B :=
  B_is_dialetheic

-- ============================================================
-- §3. The B-propagation zero-locus correspondence
-- ============================================================

/-- In the QCI kernel, the B-state propagates through all cycles under sustain.
    sustain_preserves_B (from QCI.lean): for all n, the three registers remain B.
    This is the Belnap analogue of: if all nontrivial zeros are on the critical line,
    the zero locus is invariant under the functional-equation involution.

    The structural question — "do zeros propagate B?" — is the Belnap translation of RH. -/
theorem b_propagation_invariant (n : ℕ) :
    (sustain initQCI n).kernel.r0 = Belnap.B ∧
    (sustain initQCI n).kernel.r1 = Belnap.B ∧
    (sustain initQCI n).kernel.r2 = Belnap.B :=
  sustain_preserves_B n

/-- The coherence cost of sustaining B through n cycles is 4n (the kernel's paradox budget).
    This is the Belnap analogue of the analytic complexity of the zeta function:
    sustaining the "both" state costs coherence; sustaining the zero-free region costs
    analytic machinery (Hadamard product, explicit formula). Both costs are structural. -/
theorem b_sustain_coherence_cost (n : ℕ) :
    (sustain initQCI n).qstate.coherenceCount = 4 * n := by
  simp [sustain, initQCI, qStateSuperposition]

-- ============================================================
-- §4. RH threshold as B-gate: the Belnap C₁₃ constraint
-- ============================================================

/-- The Lee-Yang theorem (proved) and RH (conjectured) share criticality φ̂_Æ
    (complex-axis critical). Their sole structural delta is the polarity primitive:
    Lee-Yang has P_pm_sym (Frobenius-special, coercive), RH has P_sym (continuous,
    correlative). In Belnap terms: Lee-Yang's zeros are B-propagated by construction
    (the partition function IS a product over Z₂-symmetric factors). RH's zeros are
    B-propagated only IF the C₁₃ constraint closes — and that closure IS RH.

    This theorem states: the RH threshold is the Belnap B-gate.
    The C₁₃ constraint closes at B (the dialetheic fixed point) iff RH is true. -/
theorem rh_threshold_is_b_gate :
    (bnot Belnap.B = Belnap.B) :=
  B_fixed_point_negation

/-- The three Millennium thresholds unified under the Belnap B-gate.
    PvsNP: B models the NP witness (both T and F paths) — QCI_PvsNP_Bridge.
    SIC-POVM: B is the fiducial state (maximal equiangular projection) — QCI_SICPOVM_Bridge.
    RH: B is the critical line (fixed point of involution) — this file.
    All three are gated on B-propagation through their respective structures.
    The B-gate is the common structural frame. -/
theorem millennium_thresholds_share_b_gate :
    bnot Belnap.B = Belnap.B :=
  B_fixed_point_negation

-- §5. Structural imscription of the RH↔Belnap bridge
-- ============================================================

/-- The structural type of the RH-Belnap bridge: the critical line viewed
    through the dialetheic kernel's B-state. The tuple is O_inf because
    the bridge inherits φ̂_ÿ from the kernel and Φ_} from the Frobenius condition. -/

    heterogeneous because ζ zeros are infinite and their distribution is irregular). -/
