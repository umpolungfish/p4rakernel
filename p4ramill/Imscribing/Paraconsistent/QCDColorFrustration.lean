-- QCD COLOR FRUSTRATION — SU(3) triadic constraint formalized
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙perator
--
-- Electron orbitals occupy FDE 4 (Belnap FOUR): N < {T, F} < B
--   where T and F are two incomparable middle values that can pair (T+F→B).
--
-- Quark colors occupy FDE 5 (Color FIVE): Vacuum < {R, G, B} < White
--   where R, G, B are THREE incomparable middle values.
--
-- The CRITICAL DIFFERENCE: In FDE(2), the two middle values {T, F} are
-- mutually exclusive BUT they can form a B-state via the join (T∨F = B).
-- In FDE(3), the three middle values {R, G, B} form a frustrated triad:
--   - Any two joined produce White in the information order (R∨G = White)
--   - BUT that White is NOT a physical singlet — it is a color-octet state
--   - A genuine singlet requires ALL THREE colors (R+G+B) or color-anticolor
--
-- This is the structural origin of confinement: the triadic frustration
-- means no two-color subsystem can become deconfined. You either have
-- the full triad or color-anticolor — nothing less.

    Proof: By the set equality, {c1,c2,c3} is exactly {R,G,B}, so the three
    elements are R,G,B in some order. We do case analysis on all assignments
    of c1,c2,c3 to ColorState (5^3 = 125 cases), and verify that whenever

-- §6  COMPARISON: FDE(2) vs FDE(3) — Why SU(3) Frustrates
-- ============================================================================

/-- In FDE(2) (Belnap FOUR), the two middle values {T, F} are enough
    to reach the top B via join: T ∨ F = B. There is no frustration
    because two values can pair to reach the ceiling.
    
    In FDE(3) (Color FIVE), the three middle values {R, G, B} form
    a FRUSTRATED TRIAD: any two join to White (top), but that White
    is NOT a genuine singlet. The third color is structurally necessary.
    
    This is the structural origin of why SU(3) exhibits confinement
    while SU(2) does not. -/

/-- Cardinality matters: with 2 middle values, the ceiling is 2-accessible.
    With 3 middle values, the ceiling requires 3 (or a color-anticolor pair).
    The key structural invariant: for FDE(n), the ceiling is ⌈n/2⌉-accessible
    for the physical singlet when n is even, and requires n for odd n.
    
    For n=2 (FDE(2)/Belnap): T+F → B works (2 values reach top)
    For n=3 (FDE(3)/Color): R+G fails to make singlet; need R+G+B
    For n=4 (FDE(4)/Preon): need color-anticolor or all 4
