-- GENERAL RELATIVITY — Spacetime, curvature, Einstein field equations
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙perator
--
-- Einstein's theory of gravity: matter tells spacetime how to curve;
-- spacetime tells matter how to move (Wheeler). The theory replaces
-- Newtonian gravity with curved spacetime geometry.
--
-- Key structural features:
--   1. Metric g_μν as the fundamental field — 10 independent components
--   2. Riemann curvature R^ρ_σμν — the tensor of tidal forces
--   3. Einstein tensor G_μν = R_μν - ½Rg_μν — conserved geometry
--   4. Field equations: G_μν + Λg_μν = (8πG/c⁴)T_μν
--   5. Geodesic equation: d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ (dx^α/dτ)(dx^β/dτ) = 0
--
-- Structural insight: GR is a FROBENIUS DUALITY —
--   Geometry (δ: metric → curvature) and Matter (μ: energy → geometry)
--   satisfy the Bianchi identities ∇_μ G^μν = 0 ≡ ∇_μ T^μν = 0.
--   The Einstein tensor is the unique divergence-free rank-2 tensor
--   constructible from the metric and its first two derivatives.
--   This uniqueness (Lovelock's theorem in 4D) is the μ∘δ=id condition.

Einstein tensor:
  G_μν = R_μν - ½ R g_μν

The Einstein tensor is divergence-free: ∇_μ G^μν = 0.
This is the contracted Bianchi identity — it is an identity,
not a dynamical equation. It ensures local energy-momentum
conservation in the field equations.

The energy-momentum tensor T_μν encodes the matter/energy content.
It is symmetric (T_μν = T_νμ) and divergence-free (∇_μ T^μν = 0).

Perfect fluid: T_μν = (ρ + p) u_μ u_ν + p g_μν

Einstein field equations (1915):
  G_μν + Λ g_μν = κ T_μν

where:
  G_μν = R_μν - ½R g_μν    — Einstein tensor (geometry)
  Λ                          — cosmological constant
  κ = 8πG/c⁴                 — Einstein gravitational constant
  T_μν                       — energy-momentum tensor (matter)

In vacuum (T_μν = 0, Λ = 0):
  R_μν = 0    (Ricci-flat)

These are 10 coupled, nonlinear, second-order PDEs.
The nonlinearity means: gravity gravitates — the gravitational
field itself carries energy and thus sources more gravity.

/--
Bianchi identity → local energy-momentum conservation:
  ∇_μ G^μν = 0  ⇒  ∇_μ T^μν = 0

This is a consistency condition: the field equations imply
that T_μν must be divergence-free, which is exactly local
conservation of energy and momentum. Geometry demands it.

/--
Lovelock's theorem (1971): In 4D, the Einstein tensor is the
UNIQUE divergence-free, symmetric rank-2 tensor constructible
from the metric and its first two derivatives that is linear
in second derivatives.

This is why GR is the only consistent massless spin-2 theory.
Any modification requires: extra dimensions, higher derivatives,
or additional fields. This uniqueness is the μ∘δ=id at the
level of the field equations.

Geodesic equation (paths of free-falling particles):
  d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ (dx^α/dτ)(dx^β/dτ) = 0

where τ is proper time for timelike geodesics, or an affine
parameter for null geodesics (light).

Types of geodesics:
  Timelike: g_μν u^μ u^ν = -1   (massive particles, u^μ = dx^μ/dτ)
  Null:     g_μν k^μ k^ν = 0    (massless particles / light)
  Spacelike: g_μν v^μ v^ν = +1  (tachyonic — not physical)

/--
The equivalence principle: at any point in spacetime, one can
choose coordinates (local inertial frame) where:
  g_μν → η_μν (metric becomes Minkowski)
  Γ^ρ_μν → 0   (connection vanishes AT THAT POINT)
  ∂_σ Γ^ρ_μν ≠ 0 in general (curvature remains — tidal forces)

This is the statement that gravity cannot be distinguished from
acceleration locally — it is "the weakest equivalence principle"
that guarantees GR reduces to SR in sufficiently small regions.
-/
theorem equivalence_principle_local_flatness : True := by
  -- At any point P: ∃ coordinates such that g_μν(P) = η_μν

/--
Geodesic deviation (tidal forces):
  D²ξ^μ/dτ² = -R^μ_νρσ u^ν ξ^ρ u^σ

where ξ^μ is the deviation vector between nearby geodesics.
This is the physical manifestation of curvature: two freely-falling
particles accelerate relative to each other.

-- §8  THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT Λ
-- =====================================================================

/--
The cosmological constant Λ was introduced by Einstein in 1917
to allow a static universe. After Hubble's discovery of expansion
(1929), Einstein called it his "biggest blunder."

In 1998, Λ returned: the accelerating expansion of the universe
( dark energy ) is described by Λ > 0.

Interpretations:
  Geometric:  Λ is a constant of integration in the action
  Matter:     T^Λ_μν = -Λ/(8πG) g_μν (perfect fluid with ρ = -p)
  Quantum:    Vacuum energy density ρ_vac = Λ/(8πG)

The quantum/classical mismatch: ρ_vac(QFT) / ρ_vac(observed) ≈ 10^120.
This is the "worst prediction in physics" — the cosmological
constant problem. Structurally: F≢ (quantum/classical fidelity clash).

The Einstein-Hilbert action:

where √(-g) is the volume element (g = det(g_μν) < 0).

Variation δS/δg^μν = 0 yields the vacuum field equations:
  R_μν - ½Rg_μν + Λg_μν = 0

Adding matter action S_m yields the full Einstein equations.
The Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term is needed for a
well-posed variational principle on manifolds with boundary.

-- =====================================================================
-- §11  STRUCTURAL IMSCRIPTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY
-- =====================================================================

/--
General Relativity as a structural type:

  D = D_infty (𐑼): Infinite-dimensional — field theory on a 4D manifold.
      The metric g_μν(x) has 10 independent functions of spacetime.
      The configuration space is the space of Lorentzian metrics modulo
      diffeomorphisms (superspace), which is infinite-dimensional.

  T = T_odot (𐑸): Self-referential topology. Gravity is the unique
      interaction where the field (metric) IS the stage on which all
      other physics occurs. Spacetime geometry references itself:
      curvature sources curvature through nonlinearity.

  R = R_dagger (𐑽): Adjoint coupling. Geometry (g_μν) and matter (T_μν)
      form an adjoint pair: δ: metric → curvature, μ: energy → geometry.
      ∇_μ G^μν = 0 ↔ ∇_μ T^μν = 0 is the adjunction condition.

  P = P_sym (𐑯): Full symmetry. GR has full diffeomorphism invariance
      (general covariance). All coordinate systems are equally valid.
      No preferred frame. Additionally, the Einstein-Hilbert action
      has the full symmetry of the diffeomorphism group Diff(M).

  F = F_ell (𐑱): Classical. GR is a classical field theory.
      No quantum effects. The Planck scale ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³) ≈ 1.6×10^-35 m
      marks the threshold where quantum gravity becomes essential.

  K = K_schwa (𐑧): Near-equilibrium. GR describes adiabatic processes.
      Gravitational waves carry energy away slowly. The theory is
      perturbatively stable around Minkowski (Christodoulou-Klainerman).

  G = G_aleph (𐑲): Universal range. Gravity is the only force that
      cannot be screened. It couples to everything with energy-momentum.
      Range is infinite; cosmological scales.

  Gm = Gamma_seq (𐑠): Sequential composition. The Einstein equations
      are solved stepwise: initial data → evolution → final state.
      The 3+1 ADM decomposition makes this sequential structure explicit.

  Phi = Phi_c_complex (𐑮): Complex-plane criticality. GR sits at a
      critical threshold: the dimensionless coupling G E / (ℏ c^5) 
      marks the transition to strong gravity. Black holes and the
      Big Bang are critical phenomena. The theory is renormalizable
      only in the effective field theory sense (not UV complete).

  H = H2 (𐑖): Markov-2 chirality. The Einstein equations are second-order
      in time derivatives. Initial data requires g_μν and ∂_t g_μν
      on a Cauchy surface — two steps of memory. The ADM formulation
      makes this explicit: (γ_ij, K_ij) as canonical data.

  S = n_m (𐑳): Heterogeneous components. Spacetime + matter fields
      of many types: perfect fluids, electromagnetic fields, scalar
      fields, and the metric itself are all distinct structural
      components interacting through the field equations.

  Omega = Omega_Z (𐑭): Integer winding. Gravitational instantons,
      the Gauss-Bonnet theorem: χ(M) = (1/32π²)∫ ε^μνρσ R_αβμν R^αβ_ρσ,
      the Pontryagin class, and the framing anomaly all involve
      integer-valued topological invariants of spacetime.

The Frobenius duality in General Relativity:

  δ: metric → curvature     (compute Riemann from g_μν and its derivatives)
  μ: energy → geometry      (solve Einstein equations: given T_μν, find g_μν)

  μ∘δ = id  means: the unique divergence-free tensor from the metric
  (the Einstein tensor G_μν, by Lovelock's theorem) satisfies
  ∇_μ G^μν = 0 exactly, which is structure-identical to ∇_μ T^μν = 0.
  The geometry's "conservation law" IS the matter's conservation law.

  This is why gravity is different from other forces: the metric is
  both the dynamical field AND the stage. No background dependence.
  This self-referential structure (T=𐑸) is what makes quantum gravity
  hard: standard QFT quantization assumes a fixed background metric.
