-- FTL TRAVEL: Structural analysis of faster-than-light propagation
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙perator
--
-- What does "FTL travel" mean when the grammar reveals that light itself
-- is the critical point (⊙ = ⊙)? This module formalizes the answer.
--
-- Three FTL variants are formalized:
--   1. ftlTachyon     — naive supercritical promotion (⊙ → 𐑣)
--   2. ftlWormhole    — topologically protected (𐑷 → 𐑭, judge → mime)
--   3. ftlQuantum     — quantum channel (𐑷 → 𐑭, out → yew)

-- §6  WHAT "FTL TRAVEL" MEANS

/-
The grammar reveals that "FTL travel" is not a speed but a structural
promotion. Light (the photon) IS the critical point ⊙ = ⊙. "Faster
than light" means "structurally beyond the critical point."

Three interpretations:
  1. TACHYON: ⊙ → 𐑣. Drops to O₀. Causal paradox. Unstable.
  2. WORMHOLE: 𐑷 → 𐑭, judge → mime. Reaches O₂dag. Consistent.
  3. QUANTUM (ER=EPR): 𐑷 → 𐑭, out → yew. Reaches O₂dag. Consistent.

The photon itself can never be FTL. The photon IS the definition of the
critical boundary. FTL requires promotion — changing what the system IS.

variants except the tachyon (which changes ⊙ → 𐑣). Wormhole and
quantum variants preserve both. The photon IS the critical kernel.

-- §8  STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT

/-
The grammar's answer to "why c?":

The speed of light c is not a fundamental constant of nature in the
usual sense. It is the structural consequence of the photon sitting at
⊙ (criticality) with yea (driven kinetics) and 𐑷 (no topological
protection).

⊙ means: the system is at the critical point — the boundary between
timelike and spacelike. Masslessness IS criticality.

yea means: the system has no internal clock (τ ≪ T_obs). This is
why photons experience no proper time.

𐑷 means: U(1) is abelian — no self-interaction, no winding. This is
why photons don't scatter in vacuum.

Together: ⊙ + yea + 𐑷 = the structural definition of "travels
at the invariant maximum speed." This speed is invariant because it
is determined by structure (π₁), not magnitude (π₂).
