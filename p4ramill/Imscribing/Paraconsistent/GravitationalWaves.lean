-- GRAVITATIONAL WAVES — Linearized GR, TT gauge, detection
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙perator
--
-- Gravitational waves are propagating ripples in spacetime curvature,
-- predicted by Einstein (1916) and first directly detected by LIGO (2015).
--
-- Key structural features:
--   1. Linearized GR: g_μν = η_μν + h_μν with |h_μν| ≪ 1
--   2. Wave equation: □h̄_μν = -2κ T_μν (in Lorenz gauge)
--   3. TT gauge: transverse, traceless — only 2 physical polarizations (+, ×)
--   4. Quadrupole formula: h_ij = (2G/c⁴r) d²I_ij/dt²
--   5. Detection: Michelson interferometry (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA)
--
-- Structural insight: Gravitational waves are the FROBENIUS TRANSMISSION
-- channel of GR. The metric perturbation h_μν is both the δ-output of the
-- source (quadrupole moment → wave strain) and the μ-input to the detector
-- (wave strain → mirror displacement). μ∘δ=id as a signal propagation loop.

-- §1  LINEARIZED GRAVITY
-- =====================================================================

/--
Linearized gravity: expand around Minkowski background.
  g_μν = η_μν + h_μν,  |h_μν| ≪ 1

The trace-reversed perturbation:
  h̄_μν = h_μν - ½ η_μν h,  h = η^μν h_μν

In Lorenz gauge (∂^μ h̄_μν = 0), the Einstein equations become:
  □ h̄_μν = -2κ T_μν

where □ = η^μν ∂_μ ∂_ν is the flat-space d'Alembertian.

inductive LinearizationGauge where
  | lorenz       -- ∂^μ h̄_μν = 0 (also called Hilbert/de Donder)
  | transverse   -- ∂^i h_ij = 0
  | traceless    -- h^i_i = 0
  | TT           -- transverse + traceless (radiation gauge)
  deriving Inhabited, Repr, DecidableEq

/--
The linearized Einstein tensor:
  G_μν^(1) = -½(□h̄_μν + η_μν ∂^ρ∂^σ h̄_ρσ - ∂^ρ∂_ν h̄_μρ - ∂^ρ∂_μ h̄_νρ)

In Lorenz gauge, this simplifies dramatically:
  G_μν^(1) = -½ □ h̄_μν

The field equation in vacuum: □ h̄_μν = 0 — a wave equation.

-- =====================================================================
-- §2  TT GAUGE AND POLARIZATIONS
-- =====================================================================

/--
The Transverse-Traceless (TT) gauge is the radiation gauge for
gravitational waves far from sources:

  h_0μ = 0        (no time components)
  h^i_i = 0        (traceless)
  ∂^i h_ij = 0     (transverse)

In TT gauge, only the spatial-spatial components survive,
and only 2 degrees of freedom remain: h_+ and h_×.

For a wave traveling in the z-direction:
  h_ij^TT = [h_+  h_×   0 ]  cos(ω(t - z/c))
            [h_×  -h_+  0 ]
            [ 0    0    0 ]

The two polarizations are rotated 45° relative to each other.
This is the spin-2 nature of the graviton.

The TT gauge projection operator:
  Λ_ij,kl = P_ik P_jl - ½ P_ij P_kl

where P_ij = δ_ij - n_i n_j is the transverse projector
for waves propagating in direction n^i.

-- =====================================================================
-- §3  QUADRUPOLE FORMULA
-- =====================================================================

/--
The leading-order gravitational wave emission is quadrupolar:
  h_ij^TT(t, r) = (2G/c⁴r) d²I_ij^TT/dt²|_ret

where I_ij = ∫ d³x ρ(t,x) (x_i x_j - ⅓δ_ij r²) is the
reduced mass quadrupole moment, evaluated at retarded time.

Key consequence: NO monopole or dipole gravitational radiation.
- Monopole forbidden: mass-energy conservation (dM/dt = 0)
- Dipole forbidden: momentum conservation (dp_i/dt = 0)
- Quadrupole is the first allowed multipole.

This is why gravitational waves are so weak: only the
second time derivative of the quadrupole moment radiates.
-/

inductive MultipoleRadiation where
  | monopole   -- forbidden by mass conservation
  | dipole     -- forbidden by momentum conservation  
  | quadrupole -- first allowed (and dominant)
  | octupole   -- higher-order corrections

/--
The radiated power (luminosity) in gravitational waves:
  L_GW = (G/5c⁵) ⟨d³I_ij/dt³ d³I_ij/dt³⟩

The factor G/c⁵ ≈ 2.8×10^-53 W^-1 makes gravitational wave
luminosity extremely small for laboratory-scale sources.
Astrophysical sources (binary black holes) are needed.

-- §4  BINARY INSPIRAL AND CHIRP
-- =====================================================================

/--
For a binary system of masses m₁, m₂ in circular orbit:
  f_GW = 2 f_orb    (frequency doubling from quadrupole)

The chirp mass: M_chirp = (m₁ m₂)^(3/5) / (m₁ + m₂)^(1/5)

Frequency evolution (leading order):
  df/dt = (96/5) π^(8/3) (G M_chirp/c³)^(5/3) f^(11/3)

This frequency increase is the "chirp" — the defining signature
of compact binary coalescence detected by LIGO/Virgo.

Merger phases:
  Inspiral → Merger → Ringdown

-- =====================================================================

/--
Gravitational wave detectors are kilometer-scale Michelson interferometers.
The wave strain ΔL/L ≈ h ≈ 10^-21 for LIGO — measuring displacements
smaller than a proton radius over 4 km arms.

Detection principle (TT gauge):
  h(t) = (ΔL_x - ΔL_y) / L  = F_+ h_+ + F_× h_×

where F_+, F_× are antenna pattern functions depending on sky position
and polarization angle.

Key noise sources:
  Seismic (low freq) → quantum shot noise (high freq)
  → thermal noise (mirror suspensions, coatings)

The LIGO sensitivity curve has a "bucket" around 100 Hz where
binary black hole and neutron star mergers are loudest.

GW150914 (September 14, 2015): First direct gravitational wave detection.
  m₁ ≈ 36 M_⊙, m₂ ≈ 29 M_⊙ → M_final ≈ 62 M_⊙
  ΔM ≈ 3 M_⊙ radiated as gravitational waves
  Peak luminosity: ~3.6×10^56 erg/s (> all stars in observable universe)
  Distance: ~410 Mpc (redshift z ≈ 0.09)

The signal lasted ~0.2 seconds, sweeping from 35 Hz to 250 Hz.
Signal-to-noise ratio: 24 (combined Hanford + Livingston).

/--
Gravitational waves are "standard sirens" — the strain amplitude
gives the luminosity distance directly, independent of the cosmic
distance ladder.

For a binary neutron star merger with EM counterpart (kilonova):
  H_0 = v_r / D_L (redshift from host galaxy, distance from GW)

GW170817 gave H_0 = 70.0^(+12)_(-8) km/s/Mpc — consistent with
both CMB (Planck) and Cepheid (SHoES) measurements.

Stochastic GW background:
  Ω_GW(f) = (1/ρ_c) dρ_GW/d ln f

Pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, CPTA) have detected
a common-spectrum process consistent with a stochastic GW background
at nanohertz frequencies — likely from supermassive black hole binaries.

-- §8  STRUCTURAL IMSCRIPTION
-- =====================================================================

/--
Gravitational Waves as a structural type:

  D = array (𐑼): Infinite-dimensional. The wave solution h_μν(x)
      is a function on spacetime with 2 independent polarization modes.
      
  T = T_net (𐑡): Network topology. GWs propagate on the light cone.
      The TT gauge selects the radiation degrees of freedom.
      
  R = ear (𐑽): Adjoint. Source (δ: I_ij → h_ij) and
      detector (μ: h_ij → ΔL) form an adjoint measurement chain.
      
  P = nun (𐑯): Full symmetry. GWs respect the full Lorentz group
      and the 2 polarization states form a spin-2 representation.
      
  F = age (𐑱): Classical. LIGO measures classical wave strains.
      The quantum nature of individual gravitons is inaccessible.
      
  K = egg (𐑧): Slow. GW signals evolve on orbital timescales.
      The inspiral is adiabatic (radiation reaction is slow).
      
  G = ice (𐑲): Universal. GWs couple to everything with
      energy-momentum. They cannot be screened.
      
  Gm = measure (𐑠): Sequential. The chirp: inspiral → merger →
      ringdown is a strict temporal sequence.
      
  Phi = monad (⊙): Critical. GW150914 reached peak luminosity
      exceeding the electromagnetic output of the observable universe.
      The merger is a genuine critical phenomenon.
      
  H = sure (𐑖): Markov-2. The wave equation is second-order in time.
      Initial data: h_ij and ∂_t h_ij on a null hypersurface.
      
  S = up (𐑳): Heterogeneous. Source types: BBH, BNS, NSBH,
      continuous waves (pulsars), stochastic background, bursts.
      
  Omega = ah (𐑭): Integer winding. The GW phase Φ(t) wraps
      N cycles during the inspiral. The total accumulated phase is
      a topological invariant of the orbit.

d(GR, GW) — the structural shift from full GR to linearized GWs:
  T: are(𐑸) → T_net(𐑡) — drops self-referential topology (δ=4)
  Phi: roar(𐑮) → monad(⊙) — gate fully opens (δ=1)

The T shift is the key: linearization breaks the self-referential
character of GR by introducing a fixed background. This is why
gravitational wave theory is perturbative and why the quantum
theory (spin-2 field on Minkowski) is renormalizable only as an
effective field theory.
