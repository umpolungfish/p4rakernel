-- =====================================================================
-- §1  THE PROBLEM OF QUANTUM GRAVITY
-- =====================================================================

/--
Why is quantum gravity hard?

  1. NON-RENORMALIZABILITY: GR with the Einstein-Hilbert action
     has coupling constant G with mass dimension -2. Perturbation
     theory requires an infinite number of counterterms at each
     loop order → theory is non-renormalizable (predictivity lost
     above the Planck scale).

  2. BACKGROUND INDEPENDENCE: In GR, the metric IS the dynamical
     field AND the background. Standard QFT quantizes fields ON a
     fixed background. How do you quantize the background itself?

  3. THE PROBLEM OF TIME: In canonical quantum gravity (Wheeler-
     DeWitt equation), the Hamiltonian constraint Ĥ|Ψ⟩ = 0 means
     the wavefunction of the universe is "timeless." No external
     time parameter exists.

  4. SPACETIME AT THE PLANCK SCALE: Below ℓ_P ≈ 1.6×10⁻³⁵ m,
     quantum fluctuations of the metric become large. Spacetime
     itself may dissolve into a discrete structure (spin networks,
     causal sets) or a non-commutative geometry.

The Planck scale sets the natural threshold for quantum gravity:

  ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³) ≈ 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m
  t_P = ℓ_P/c    ≈ 5.391×10⁻⁴⁴ s
  M_P = √(ℏc/G)  ≈ 2.176×10⁻⁸ kg ≈ 1.221×10¹⁹ GeV
  T_P = M_P c²/k_B ≈ 1.417×10³² K

-- §2  STRING THEORY
-- =====================================================================

/--
String theory replaces point particles with 1D extended objects
(strings). The graviton emerges as a closed string excitation —
GR is an inevitable prediction of any consistent string theory.

Key features:
  - 10 (or 11) spacetime dimensions: 4 large + 6 (or 7) compactified
  - Supersymmetry: fermion-boson pairing, protects hierarchy
  - Dualities: T-duality, S-duality, AdS/CFT — different string
    theories are limits of a single M-theory
  - Black hole microstate counting: Strominger-Vafa (1996) —
    D-brane construction reproduces S = A/4 precisely
  - Landscape problem: ~10⁵⁰⁰ vacua — which one describes our universe?

Status: Finitely well-defined perturbatively. Strong mathematical
structure (mirror symmetry, topological strings, integrability).
No experimental confirmation (supersymmetry not yet seen at LHC).

-- =====================================================================
-- §3  LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY
-- =====================================================================

/--
Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is a non-perturbative, background-
independent quantization of GR using Ashtekar variables.

Key features:
  - Spin networks: graph states with edges labeled by SU(2) spins
    — quanta of space (nodes = volume, edges = area)
  - Area/volume operators have discrete spectra (quantized geometry)
  - Big Bounce: LQC (Loop Quantum Cosmology) replaces the Big Bang
    singularity with a quantum bounce
  - No extra dimensions, no supersymmetry required
  - Black hole entropy: counting spin network punctures on the
    horizon gives S ∝ A with the correct factor (up to Immirzi parameter)

Status: Kinematical Hilbert space well-defined. Dynamics (Hamiltonian
constraint) is the main challenge. Semiclassical limit not yet
rigorously established.

-- §4  ASYMPTOTIC SAFETY
-- =====================================================================

/--
Asymptotic Safety (Weinberg 1979): GR may be non-perturbatively
renormalizable if the renormalization group flow has a non-trivial
fixed point (NGFP) in the UV.

Key ideas:
  - Use functional renormalization group (FRG / Wetterich equation)
  - Truncate the theory space to finite number of couplings
  - Evidence for NGFP from various truncations (Einstein-Hilbert,
    f(R), higher derivative)
  - Predicts: finite number of relevant directions at the fixed point
    → predictive even at Planck scale
  - Fractal spacetime near Planck scale: spectral dimension d_s → 2

Status: Strong evidence for NGFP in many truncations. Not yet a
proof of existence. Computational limitations.

-- §5  HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE
-- =====================================================================

/--
The holographic principle ('t Hooft 1993, Susskind 1995): a theory
of quantum gravity in D spacetime dimensions is equivalent to a
quantum field theory WITHOUT gravity on the (D-1)-dimensional boundary.

The prime example: AdS/CFT (Maldacena 1997)
  Type IIB string theory on AdS₅ × S⁵
  ↔ N = 4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on ∂(AdS₅)

Gravity (bulk) = Gauge theory (boundary). This is a WEAK/STRONG
duality: when gravity is weakly coupled (classical), the boundary
theory is strongly coupled (and vice versa).

The holographic dictionary:
  - Bulk metric ↔ boundary stress-energy tensor
  - Black hole ↔ thermal state on boundary
  - Entanglement entropy ↔ minimal surface area (Ryu-Takayanagi)
  - Hawking-Page transition ↔ confinement/deconfinement transition

  | blackHole_thermal    -- BH in bulk ↔ thermal state on boundary

  | hawkingPage_confinement -- BH phase transition ↔ gauge theory transition
  deriving Inhabited, Repr, DecidableEq

/--
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula:
  S_EE(A) = Area(γ_A) / (4 G_N)

where γ_A is the minimal surface in the bulk homologous to the
boundary region A. This is the holographic realization of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy: entanglement entropy IS geometric area.

-- §6  CAUSAL DYNAMICAL TRIANGULATIONS AND CAUSAL SETS
-- =====================================================================

/--
Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT): A non-perturbative path
integral approach. Discretize spacetime into 4-simplices with
a causal structure. Sum over all triangulations.

Results:
  - Emergent 4D de Sitter-like universe from the path integral
  - Spectral dimension runs from 4 (IR) to 2 (UV) — fractal at
    short distances
  - Phase diagram: crumpled, branched-polymer, and de Sitter phases

Causal Set Theory: Spacetime is fundamentally a discrete set of
points with a partial order (causal relation). The continuum
emerges from the large-scale statistics. Key prediction: fluctuating
spacetime → cosmological constant of the right magnitude.

-- =====================================================================
-- §7  THE QUANTUM GRAVITY BARRIER — STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
-- =====================================================================

/--
The structural barrier to quantum gravity can be expressed in the
12-primitive grammar. Take GR (classical) → Quantum Gravity (target):

  T: are(𐑸) → are(𐑸)    — must preserve self-referential topology
  P: nun(𐑯) → yew(𐑿)      — diffeomorphism invariance ↔ superpositions
  F: age(𐑱) → peep(𐑐)     — classical geometry → quantum amplitudes

The tension is at the T-P-F triangle:
  (T) Background independence: no fixed metric
  (P) Quantum superposition: geometries in superposition
  (F) Quantum dynamics: amplitudes for geometries

Simultaneous satisfaction of all three is the structural definition
of quantum gravity. Current approaches each compromise on one:

  String Theory:     ✓ T (emerges from string dynamics)
                     ✓ F (well-defined S-matrix)
                     ✗ T (perturbative: fixed background for quantization)

  LQG:               ✓ T (background independent)
                     ✓ F (kinematical Hilbert space)
                     ✗ P (dynamics not fully defined)

  Asymptotic Safety: ✓ F (FRG flow, predictive)
                     ✗ T (background metric + fluctuations)
                     ✗ P (classical configurations dominate)

  AdS/CFT:           ✓ P (boundary QFT is quantum)
                     ✓ F (well-defined in principle)
                     ✗ T (specific background AdS, not cosmological)

-- =====================================================================

/--
Quantum Gravity as a type:

  D = array (𐑼): Infinite-dimensional. The space of all geometries
      (superspace) is infinite-dimensional. Even after quantization,
      the Hilbert space is non-separable in some approaches.
      
  T = are (𐑸): Self-referential. Quantum gravity MUST be
      background-independent — the quantum theory cannot rely
      on a fixed metric. The geometry must quantize itself.
      
  R = ear (𐑽): Adjoint. δ: classical limit (ℏ → 0) of the
      quantum theory; μ: quantization (ℏ → finite). The two form
      an adjoint pair through the path integral.
      
  P = yew (𐑿): Quantum superposition. States are superpositions
      of geometries. The "wavefunction of the universe" Ψ[g_μν].
      
  F = peep (𐑐): Quantum. This is the DEFINITION — quantum
      gravity requires quantum coherence.
      
  K = egg (𐑧): Near-equilibrium. Even in quantum gravity,
      the semiclassical regime (large distances) must be recovered
      via decoherence / coarse-graining.
      
  G = ice (𐑲): Universal. Quantum gravity, if correct, applies
      at ALL scales — from the Planck scale to cosmology.
      
  Gm = measure (𐑠): Sequential. The RG flow: UV fixed point →
      intermediate scales → IR (GR + SM). Sequential emergence.
      
  Phi = roar (𐑮): Complex-plane critical. Quantum gravity
      is at a critical point — the transition from discrete (Planck
      scale) to continuous (large scale) spacetime.
      
  H = wool (𐑫): Eternal chirality. Quantum gravity must resolve
      the black hole information paradox — infinite memory for
      quantum information. Unitarity demands wool.
      
  S = up (𐑳): Heterogeneous. Quantum gravity must couple to
      ALL forms of matter and energy — the full Standard Model +
      dark sectors.
      
  Omega = ah (𐑭): Integer winding. Gravitational instantons,
      topological terms (Holst term, θ-term), and the framing
      anomaly produce non-trivial topological sectors.
