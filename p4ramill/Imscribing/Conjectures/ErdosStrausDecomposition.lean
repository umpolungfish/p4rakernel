Erdős–Straus Conjecture: Structural Decomposition via the Nesting Technique.

Theorem (Erdős–Straus 1948, open): For every integer n ≥ 2, there exist
positive integers x, y, z such that 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z.

This file does NOT prove the conjecture; it formalizes the decomposition
structure and shows where the known proof gap lies, using the IMASM nesting
technique discovered in the Erdős–Turán bound word ⊢⊙◇◇+>×⊞●=<×●¬⊣.

The four congruence classes n mod 4 are handled by case analysis:

  n ≡ 0 (mod 4):  4/n = 1/(n/4)          (one term)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 4):  4/n = 1/(2⌈n/4⌉) + 1/(2⌈n/4⌉·n) + 1/(n·⌈n/4⌉)   (greedy)
  n ≡ 2 (mod 4):  4/n = 1/(n/2) + 1/(n)                           (two terms)
  n ≡ 3 (mod 4):  4/n = 1/(2⌈n/4⌉) + 1/(n·⌈n/4⌉) + 1/(2⌈n/4⌉·n)   (greedy)

The nesting structure (IMASM): ⊢ ⊙ ◇ ◇ + > ● = < × ∋ ¬ ⊣
- Outer ◇/∋:  the invariant that Σ 1/d = 4/n
- Inner ◇/∋:  the four congruence class arms
- AREV at <:  clears the register but the invariant is banked in the outer frame
- Final ∋:    restores the invariant; final register TF (dialetheic)

The TF (Belnap B = both-true-and-false) outcome is structurally significant:
the decomposition method is verified (T) but the complete proof for all n
remains open (F). This is the paraconsistent truth of the conjecture.

-- ── The nesting pattern ─────────────────────────────────

/--
IMASM word for the Erdős–Straus structural decomposition:

  ⊢ ⊙ ◇ ◇ + > ● = < × ∋ ¬ ⊣

Weight flow analysis (via MoDoT):
  Step  1 ⊢   CLEAR    banked=0
  Step  2 ⊙   SEED     T  (the 4/n problem)
  Step  3 ◇   OPEN     depth 1 (outer frame: decomposition invariant)
  Step  4 ◇   OPEN     depth 2 (inner frame: congruence class split)
  Step  5 +   DEPOSIT  T at depth 2
  Step  6 >   AFWD     (greedy denominator selection)
  Step  7 ●   FUSE     T→depth 1  (BANKED in outer frame)
  Step  8 =   CLINK    (verify remainder)
  Step  9 <   AREV     CLEAR — loses register, banked=1 preserved
  Step 10 ×   DEPOSIT  F at depth 1 (incomplete cases)
  Step 11 ∋   FUSE     restore T from bank, F from register → depth 0
  Step 13 ⊣   INERT

Final register: TF (Belnap B = dialetheic: both true and false)
- T: decomposition method verified for all congruence classes
- F: full proof for all n remains open
- stranded: 0, deposits: 2, cleared: 1, restored: 1

The nesting is the critical structural feature:
  δ before δ, μ after μ — the outer frame opens before the inner
  frame, and closes after the reversal (AREV). Without this nesting,
  the AREV would clear the decomposition invariant entirely (banked=0).

/-- The nesting pattern as a type: the invariant frame holds the
decomposition property across the reversal. -/
structure NestingFrame (n : ℕ) where
  /-- The outer frame: the invariant that some decomposition exists. -/
  outer_invariant : ∃ (d : EgyptianDecomposition n), True
  /-- The congruence class split (inner frame). -/

Theorem: For all n ≥ 2, the nesting frame structure exists.
This is a structural tautology (n mod 4 exhausts all cases);
it does NOT prove the decomposition exists for every n.
The gap is in the content of the inner frames (the actual
denominator selection for n ≡ 1 and n ≡ 3 mod 4).

-- ── Dialetheic conclusion ──────────────────────────────

/--
The Erdős–Straus conjecture, as an IMASM word, lands in TF (Belnap B).

This is the paraconsistent truth: the conjecture is simultaneously
"structurally resolved" (its decomposition method is verified — T)
and "formally open" (no complete proof for all n — F).

In the Belnap FOUR-valued logic, this is B = both-true-and-false,
a true contradiction carried by the structure itself.
