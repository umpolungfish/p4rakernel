-- COMPLETING THE CLASSIFIER: Ω refines O_inf into sealed / unsealed
-- ============================================================
-- `ouroboricityTier` (Core.lean) leaves Protection Ω irrelevant to O_inf: any
-- Frobenius-critical tuple lands O_inf regardless of its winding. That is the
-- gap flagged as mismatch #2 — the tier says nothing about whether the terminal
-- (G3) actually SEALS. This file closes it additively (Core is left untouched,
-- the GREEN library is not disturbed): a refined classifier `sealedTier` splits
-- O_inf by the winding, and we prove the split is exactly the G3 / unlockTerminal
-- boundary on the Hermitian-critical branch.
--
-- Honest caveat, proved as `sealed_at_roar_need_not_close`: O_inf admits both
-- monad (real-axis) and roar (complex-axis) criticality. A sealed tuple at roar
-- is winding-protected and O_inf, yet its real Frobenius trace (μ_C) does NOT
-- close. So `sealed` (a tier fact) and `unlockTerminal` (a trace fact) coincide
-- precisely on the monad branch, and we prove exactly that.
