Maximum AP-Intersecting Family

Problem: For N ≥ 1, find the largest t such that there exist
A₁,…,Aₜ ⊆ {1,…,N} with Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ a non-empty arithmetic progression
for all i ≠ j.

Answer (exact for N ≤ 8; conjectural for N ≥ 9):
  N=1: 1     N=2: 2     N=3: 4     N=4: 7
  N=5: 12    N=6: 17    N=7: 23    N=8: 30
  N=9: 39*   N=10: 48*  N≥9: C(N,2)+3*
  (* = best known lower bound; optimality conjectural)

Pattern observed:
  C(N,2)+1  ← naive star family (all N, all centers)
  C(N,2)+2  ← center-3 exceptional family (N ≥ 5, optimal for N=5..8)
  C(N,2)+3  ← center-5 AP-through-center construction (N ≥ 9, lower bound)
  The "+1 except at 5,6" framing was wrong — the exception IS the rule.

Definition of AP: A non-empty set S ⊆ ℕ is an arithmetic progression iff
its elements, when sorted, form a strictly increasing sequence with constant
positive difference d ≥ 1.  All sets of size 1 or 2 are automatically APs.
Constant progressions (d=0) are NOT considered APs.

Revision v2.2 (Math⊙perator):

  - 36 native_decide theorems (all verified)
  - Structural proof sketch for exceptionalFamily_isAP (N≥11):
    core (12 sets, ⊆{1..5}) + extension (all intersect in ≤2 elements)
  - Proof reduced to two clean sorries for N>10 (membership decomposition
    and cardinality formula); all N≤10 cases fully verified

-- ─── Lower Bound for N > 10 (structural, with sorries) ────────────────────────

/-- The exceptional family is AP-intersecting for all N ≥ 5.

    Proof sketch (verified computationally for N ≤ 10; structural for N ≥ 11):
    Every set in exceptionalFamily N contains the center 3.  Sets are either
    "small" (starFamily, size ≤ 3) or one of three "large" sets: {1,2,3,4},
    {2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5}.  The large sets only use {1,…,5}.

    For two distinct sets A, B:
    - Both small: share 3 plus at most one other element → |A∩B| ≤ 2 → AP.
    - Both large: only 3 large sets, all pairs verified by N=5 native_decide.
    - Small + large: the large set ⊆ {1,…,5}.  If the small set uses an element
      >5, it shares at most one non-3 element with the large set → |A∩B| ≤ 2 → AP.
      If the small set ⊆ {1,…,5}, we are in the N=5 core → native_decide.

    For N ≥ 11, the "core" (sets ⊆ {1,…,5}) consists of exactly the 12 sets
    from exceptionalFamily 5.  All "extension" sets (using elements >5) are
    starFamily sets of the form {3,x} or {3,x,y} with x>5 or y>5.  These
    intersect any core set in {3} or {3,k} (size ≤ 2), and intersect each
    other in {3} or {3,k} (size ≤ 2).  Hence all intersections are APs.

    Verified in Python for N up to 20: core always 12 sets, all ext ∩ core
    intersections have size ≤ 2, all ext ∩ ext intersections have size ≤ 2. -/

/-- **Main Theorem**: The size of any AP-intersecting family of subsets of
    {1,…,N} is at most maxSize(N).

    Proof:

    - N > 10: upper bound from `upper_bound_large_N` axiom (conjectural)

    Lower bounds (tightness):
    - N ≤ 10: `lower_bound_N_le_10` gives constructions achieving maxSize(N)
      exactly, all verified by `native_decide`
    - N > 10: `lower_bound_large_N` gives exceptionalFamily achieving
      C(N,2)+2 = maxSize(N)-1.  Tightness (C(N,2)+3) is conjectural.
