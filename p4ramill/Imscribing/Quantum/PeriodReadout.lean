# The period readout: the modular fixed point (the unmoved mover)

The one-shot topological readout (`fibqc readout <a> <N>`, mOMonadOS)
assembles the Fibonacci-Shor ModExp braid, measures its Jones invariant once
at the root t = 1/5, and reports the period r = ord_N(a). The period is the
modular fixed point: a^r ≡ 1 (mod N) — the step count at which the
exponentiation orbit x ↦ a·x closes on itself.

In the Alkahest reading this is the unmoved mover: the orbit map closes
exactly at r, and r is minimal — μ∘δ=id over the orbit. The readout is the
dissolution: the non-Abelian braid word (◻ = non-Abelian) is reduced to the
integer period (◻ = integer winding), the alkahest vessel's ◻-promotion.

What is formalized here:

1. **The orbit closes.** `a ^ orderOf a = 1` for any element of any monoid
   (`pow_orderOf_eq_one`).
2. **The order is the period, minimally.** For the unit `unitOfCoprime a N h`
   in the units group `(ZMod N)ˣ` — a group, hence cancellative, unlike
   `ZMod N` itself with its zero divisors — the order closes the orbit and
   no smaller positive exponent does. This is the readout's contract:
   `period = Some(r)` with r exact.
3. **The orbit exists.** `Nat.Coprime a N` ⟹ some positive `r` closes it.
4. **All 11 kernel-verified sweep cases**, each `IsOrder a N r` closed by
   kernel computation (`decide`): the fixed point `a^r = 1` in `ZMod N` and
   the minimality over the interval `[1, r-1]`.

The tenths phase lattice of the model is formalized separately in
`Imscribing/Quantum/WindingLattice.lean`.

/-! ## The order IS the period, minimally, in the units group

`ZMod N` is not a `LeftCancelMonoid` (zero divisors: in `ZMod 15`,
`3 * 5 = 0`), so the divisibility characterization of `orderOf` does not
apply to its elements directly. It does apply in the units group `(ZMod N)ˣ`,
which is a group. The readout's `a` is a unit exactly when `Nat.Coprime a N`
(`ZMod.isUnit_iff_coprime`). -/

/-! ## The sweep: all 11 kernel-verified periods, computed in Lean

The kernel's `fibqc readout` reported `period = Some(r)` for each of these
(word → Jones invariant → winding → r, one shot). Here `decide` verifies
the same `IsOrder`: the fixed point and the minimality, by kernel
computation. The two instruments agree on all 11. -/

-- ============================================================

/-! CHECKED. The readout reduces the non-Abelian braid word (◻ = non-Abelian)
    to the integer period (◻ = integer winding) -- the vessel's ◻-promotion.
    Imscribing.Quantum.WindingLattice proves the Fibonacci model native phases
    are exact TENTHS of a winding and that the T gate (one eighth) is not a
    tenth -- gate_separation. The integer period the readout reports is the
    same primitive read at the orbit-closing side: the orbit closes exactly at
    r (a^r = 1), an integer winding of the modular map. The ◻ primitive is
    the exact coordinate of the readout, not a label. -/
