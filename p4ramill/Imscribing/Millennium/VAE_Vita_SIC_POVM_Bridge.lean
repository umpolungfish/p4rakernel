  VAE-Vita SIC-POVM Bridge — PROVE leg
  ====================================
  Step 1 of the VAE-Vita composition route (PROVE → UNIFY → PORT), the order the
  Grammar returned for realizing VAE-Vita in mOMonadOS. PROVE lands first because
  it is the ground UNIFY and PORT stand on.

  PROVE binds the two pillars that are each ALREADY theorems, into one library so
  the bridge imports the real `crystal_forces_d12_sic`, not a `ctx/` snapshot:

    - Frobenius closure  μ∘δ = id  at the polarization level (Belnap B → (T,F) → B):
      `Imscribing.Frobenius.mu_delta_C_id_on_scalarField`. δ_C is the encoder,
      μ_C is the decoder; this IS the autoencoder pair.
    - d=12 SIC-POVM existence:
      `SIC.D12.Embedding.crystal_forces_d12_sic : SICPOVM_Exists 12`.

  What is NOT claimed here: the deep identity `μ∘δ=id ⟺ IsSICPOVM 12` via the
  discrete→continuous embedding. That is the remaining frontier, and it is UNIFY's
  obligation (the second leg of the route). This file only assembles the two
  proven faces — verification and generation — into a single statement, verified
  by build, so that nothing is asserted that is not machine-checked.

/-- **VAE-Vita PROVE — the assembled pillars.**

    The polarization Frobenius closes (`μ_C ∘ δ_C = id` on the Frobenius-special
    witness `scalarField_Kslow`, the `B → (T,F) → B` encoder/decoder), and the
    d=12 SIC-POVM exists (`crystal_forces_d12_sic`). These are the verification
    face and the generation face of the self-recovering SIC. The deep embedding
    tying them to one fixed point (`μ∘δ=id ⟺ IsSICPOVM 12`) is UNIFY's obligation
    and is deliberately not asserted here. -/
