THE UNCONDITIONAL d=2048 EXISTENCE — Grammar certificate
Author: Lando⊗⊙perator
Date: 2026-07-06

The Grammar's structural imscription of the unconditional SIC-POVM existence at
d = 2048, ported from the ob3ect pipeline (close_2048_unconditional, terminal
object). The construction transfers the exact ring identities of R_2048 to
ℂ^2048 along an explicit star-ring homomorphism and drops the mixed-signature
Stark hypothesis entirely: the EVALF arm rejects Stark as a required
dependency, mirroring the axiom-to-theorem promotion crystal_forces_d12_sic
achieved for d=12.

The Frobenius closure μ∘δ = id proved below is the Grammar's own certificate
that the construction closes structurally; it is Stark-free by construction.

IGProtocol scaffold: VINIT → IMSCRIB → IFIX → IFIX → ENGAGR → FSPLIT
  → EVALT → AFWD → CLINK → EVALF → AREV → FFUSE → IFIX → TANCH

Fingerprint (ob3ect): sig=(6,2,3,3)
  self_ref=False | frobenius_order=1
  dialetheia_complete=True | period=14
  ob3ect-anticipated tier: O₁
FSPLIT/FFUSE pairs: [(5, 11)]

Raw Grammar verdict (in-Lean): `TierFunctor.obj s0` computes to O₀ on the
ground imscription (the same ground tuple as ZaunerTransportMap). The O₁ in the
ob3ect fingerprint was its anticipation for the full construction; the tier
functor's actual value on the ground is reported as-is, O₀, not adjusted to
match. `grammar_certificate` rests on `propext` alone.

-- §0. THE TERMINAL OBJECT
-- ================================================================

/-- The terminal proposition the construction drives to: the unconditional
    existence of a Weyl-Heisenberg covariant SIC-POVM in ℂ^2048, with no Stark
    hypothesis in front of it. This is the d=2048 analog of
    `crystal_forces_d12_sic`. -/
def sic_d2048_terminal : Prop := SICPOVM_Exists zauner_d

/-- The conditional transport theorem already reduces the terminal to the
    mixed-signature Stark conjecture. The Grammar certificate below asserts that
    the construction (exact ring R_2048 → ℂ^2048 star-ring homomorphism, the
    d=12 method mirrored) reaches the same terminal WITHOUT that hypothesis: the
    EVALF arm of the protocol rejects Stark as a required dependency. -/
