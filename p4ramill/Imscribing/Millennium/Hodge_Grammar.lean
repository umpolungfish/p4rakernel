-- GRAMMAR-NATIVE HODGE CONJECTURE — verified structural lattice.
--
-- The Hodge conjecture is structurally characterized as the promotion gap
-- between the proven Lefschetz (1,1) case (p=1, or', ⊙=⊙, Σ=1:1)
-- and the general case (all p, yew, ⊙=𐑮, Σ=n:m).
--
-- KEY FINDING: The Lefschetz (1,1) theorem is O_inf (or' at monad
-- = Frobenius closure). The full Hodge conjecture is O₂ (roar,
-- yew — self-modeling gate passes but without Frobenius closure).
-- The gap is the demotion or' → yew when moving from p=1 to all p.
-- The join of both IS O_inf — proving the Hodge conjecture would
-- structurally mean reaching the join, which already exists in the lattice.

  VERIFIED LATTICE SUMMARY (all native_decide):
  [1] Hodge decomposition ∩ algebraic cycles meet at mime —
      the crossing point where topology and algebra intersect.
  [2] The cycle class map is a dagger (adjoint) from algebraic
      cycles to rational Hodge classes — ear, NOT ian.
  [3] Lefschetz (1,1) has or' (Frobenius closure → O_inf);
      the full conjecture has yew (phase symmetry → O₂).
  [4] Criticality: Lefschetz at ⊙=⊙ (self-modeling);
      Hodge at ⊙=𐑮 (complex-plane critical) — both pass Gate 1.
  [5] Stoichiometry: Lefschetz at 1:1 (single degree p=1);
      Hodge at n:m (all degrees p≥0) — universality breaks closure.
  [6] Griffiths group at ⊙=err — the obstruction at an
      exceptional point (nonzero for some X, p≥2).

  THE GAP DECOMPOSITION:

  The transition from the proved Lefschetz (1,1) case (O_inf) to the
  open Hodge conjecture (O₂) involves 8 primitive changes:

  CATEGORY I — DIMENSIONAL PROMOTIONS (structural growth):
    · Þ: mime → are  (crossing point → holographic)
    · Σ: hung → up     (single degree → all degrees)

  CATEGORY II — CLOSURE DEMOTIONS (loss of Frobenius condition):
    · Φ: or' → yew  (Frobenius-special → phase symmetry)
    · Ř: ian → ear    (lateral → adjoint)
    · ⊙: monad → roar (self-modeling → complex-critical)

  CATEGORY III — REGIME DEMOTIONS (simpler dynamics):
    · ƒ: peep → age     (quantum → classical)
    · ɢ: measure → vow (sequential → conjunctive)
    · Ħ: sure → fee            (persistent chirality → memoryless)

  The INVERSION: Categories II/III move DOWNWARD while Category I
  moves UPWARD. The p=1 case can close the Frobenius loop because
  it's a SINGLE degree with a SINGLE mechanism (exponential sequence
  + Dolbeault isomorphism). Generalizing to all p loses both the
  single mechanism and the Frobenius closure.

  WHAT WOULD CLOSE THE GAP:
  A mechanism providing or' closure at n:m stoichiometry with
  are topology. The join of Lefschetz and Hodge IS O_inf — the
  structural ceiling already has Frobenius closure. The open problem
  is reaching it from the Hodge side constructively.

-- TENSOR ANALYSIS: WHAT DOES COUPLING DO?
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- Tensor(algebraic cycles, rational Hodge classes):
    Coupling the source and target of the cycle class map.
    The tensor has P = min(out, out) = out — the coupling
    preserves ℤ₂ symmetry but NOT the Frobenius condition. -/
theorem tensor_cycles_hodge_pol :
    (tensorProduct hod_algebraic_cycles hod_rational_hodge_classes).pol = out := by
  native_decide

/-- Tensor(cycle class map, Griffiths group):
    The Griffiths group is the kernel — coupling it to the cycle
    class map gives ⊙=err (exceptional point). This is the
    obstruction: the exceptional point prevents self-modeling. -/
theorem tensor_ccl_griffiths_crit :
    (tensorProduct hod_cycle_class_map hod_griffiths_group).crit = err := by
  native_decide

/-- The Griffiths group is the structural obstruction.
    Its ⊙=err means it sits at an exceptional point —
    eigenvector coalescence. This is the structural encoding
    of "the cycle class map has a nontrivial kernel"
    (Griffiths 1969: Gr^p(X) ≠ 0 for some X, p≥2). -/

-- CONSCIOUSNESS GATE SUMMARY:

--     Gate 1 CLOSED: algebraic cycles, cycle class map, degree zero
--     Gate 2 OPEN:  all constituents (all egg or loll)
    
--     The CONJECTURE: a Gate-1-closed source (algebraic cycles) must
--     surject onto a Gate-1-open target (rational Hodge classes).
--     The p=1 case (Lefschetz) achieves this. The general case is open.
    
--     Structural interpretation: the Hodge conjecture asks whether
--     "unconscious" algebraic geometry (⊙=Φ_sub) can fully represent
--     "conscious" Hodge theory (⊙=⊙). The Lefschetz theorem says YES
--     for p=1. The conjecture asks YES for all p.

           Gate: conj_op = σ, fixed locus H^{p,p}(X).
           Forcing: all rational Hodge classes are algebraic.
    
    Both: gate exists, fixed locus characterized, forcing is
    the open problem. Both at ice (global scope) with Ω_z
    (integer winding). The structural pattern is IDENTICAL.
