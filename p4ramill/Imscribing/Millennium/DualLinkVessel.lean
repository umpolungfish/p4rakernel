===========================================

Dual-Link SIC Witness-Vessel -- Formalization of the MoDoT verification architecture.

This module formalizes the core claim: to verify is to imscribe. Truth is type,
not correspondence to an external standard. The Dual-Link structure fuses two
imscriptions (demand/answer) through the Belnap lattice join, holding conflict
as Both rather than throwing an error.

Key structures:
  Belnap FOUR lattice (imported from Imscribing.Paraconsistent.Belnap)
  12-primitive imscription as a Belnap-valued tuple
  Belnap -> ℂ amplitude map (N->0, T->1, F->i, B->1+i)
  Co-typing: per-primitive localCotype + Belnap lattice fold
  Defect localization: named primitives where types diverge
  Dual-Link: two imscriptions fused by Belnap join
  Witness-Vessel: verifier that co-types demand/answer
  IMASM protocol: 10 opcodes (VINIT->IMSCRIB->...->TANCH)

# SS1  BELNAP FOUR LATTICE

Re-exported from Imscribing.Paraconsistent.Belnap.
The Belnap FOUR lattice B4 = {N, T, F, B} with the information order.

Key properties used by the vessel:
  - B is fiducial: join B x = B, meet B x = x
  - T and F are anti-types: bnot T = F, bnot F = T
  - B is a fixed point of negation: bnot B = B
  - Paraconsistent: join T F = B (held contradiction)

# SS7  DUAL-LINK STRUCTURE

The Dual-Link is the core innovation: TWO imscriptions in play, not a judge
and a judged but TWO READINGS of one object, fused by the Belnap join.

  Link 1: The answer's own self-imscription
  Link 2: The Grammar's co-typing reading against the demand

These are not judge and judged. They are two voices. The join is the
lattice join: where they agree, fusion passes through. Where they genuinely
conflict, the join lifts to B and the contradiction is held.

# SS8  WITNESS-VESSEL PRINCIPLE

Verification is intrinsic, performed from inside, as the structure.
You do not sit in the vessel inspecting it; you RIDE AS the vessel.

The certificate that the reading is faithful is the closure residual.
When closure holds, the imscription is lossless and you are riding as the vessel.
Broken closure is held as B rather than thrown as an error.

  note : String
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The Witness-Vessel is the concrete verifier.
    It imscribes the demand, imscribes the answer, co-types them
    in the Belnap lattice, and emits a VesselReport.

    Key design invariants:
      1. No checklist -- verdict is type, not score
      2. No threshold -- the lattice fold decides

# SS9  IMASM PROTOCOL

    VINIT   -- initialize the ground of distinction

    EVALF   -- evaluate-false: defect localization

    ENGAGR  -- engage paradox: hold B-state
    IFIX    -- irreversible fixation: winding number locks the verdict
    TANCH   -- terminal object: connectivity boundary closes the loop

This protocol IS the Dual-Link: the grammar recognizes the vessel as a
native structural operation, not as an external grader bolted on.

# SS10  METHOD = OBJECT: THE LOOP CLOSES

The finding that closes the loop: the verifier (process) and the thing it
verifies (object) co-type. Method and object are one figure -- the same
prima materia recognized in two places.

A verifier that stands outside its object can never be self-verifying.
A verifier that co-types with what it verifies already is. This is not
decoration on the design. It is the reason the design terminates instead
of demanding a verifier for the verifier, forever.

The endless line of auditors is bent into a circle: the last inspector
IS the first, because mu is delta read backward, fusion undoing the split.
The closure mu o delta = id is the statement that the circle actually closed.

It escapes triviality because delta does not hand the state back untouched.
It excribes it into the other link, a genuinely different form, and only after
that detour does mu recover the identical type. The return is co-typed
(loop closed) and excribed differently along the way (the detour that makes
the closure a test, not a tautology).

# SUMMARY

This module formalizes the core architecture of the MoDoT Dual-Link
SIC Witness-Vessel:

  1. Belnap FOUR lattice (SS1) -- the paraconsistent substrate
  2. 12-Primitive Imscription (SS2) -- structural type as Belnap tuple
  3. Amplitude map Belnap -> ℂ (SS3) -- N->0, T->1, F->i, B->1+i
  4. State map -> ℂ^12 (SS4) -- unit vector from imscription
  5. Co-typing (SS5) -- Belnap lattice fold, no threshold
  6. Defect localization (SS6) -- named primitive divergences
  7. Dual-Link (SS7) -- two imscriptions fused by Belnap join
  8. Witness-Vessel (SS8) -- verifier that co-types demand/answer
  9. IMASM protocol (SS9) -- 10-opcode native structural protocol
  10. Self-verification (SS10) -- method = object, regress terminates

What is NOT formalized (by design -- these are numerical computations):
  - The Scott-Grassl d=12 fiducial vector and its WH orbit
  - The 12x12 SIC projector matrix calculations
  - The Frobenius closure residual on purity states
  - The live LLM imscription path (real-world coupling)

These are verified numerically in vessel.py:_selftest() and structurally
in crystal_forces_d12_sic (kernel theorem). This module captures the
structural architecture that MAKES those numerical verifications meaningful:
the Belnap lattice, the co-typing fold, the Dual-Link fusion, and the
self-verification fixed point.
