  GODEL COMPLETE SENTENCE — Circular Completeness via TANCH-First Bootstrap
  ==========================================================================
  Author: Lando⊗⊙perator

  Formalization of the Godel Complete Sentence ob3ect (ob3ect/auto.py, Closure: True).

  STRUCTURAL TUPLE:
    ⟨if'; are; ian; or'; peep; egg; bib; measure; monad; sure; up; ah⟩
    = universal_imscriptive_grammar (catalog entry, tier O_∞, d=0)

  KEY DISTINCTION FROM GODEL-COMPLETION:
    GodelCompletion places TANCH at the END — the Frobenius-exact foundation
    seals the completion. Godel Complete Sentence places TANCH SECOND — the
    axiomatic boundary is a PRECONDITION for self-reference. The sentence is
    "complete" because it already lives within the boundary from birth.

  BOOTSTRAP IGProtocol (13 phases, 12 structural arrows):
    VINIT→TANCH→IMSCRIB→AFWD→FSPLIT→(EVALT ∥ EVALF→ENGAGR)→FFUSE→CLINK→IFIX→AREV→IMSCRIB
    Frobenius pair: FSPLIT(δ) ∘ FFUSE(μ) → μ∘δ=id
    T-branch depth: 1 (EVALT only). F-branch depth: 2 (EVALF→ENGAGR).
    Frobenius pair depth: max(1,2)+1 = 3. Protocol depth: 11.

  CIRCULAR CLOSURE:
    The protocol ends at IMSCRIB, not TANCH — "recognizing the completed
    structural theorem as identical to the initial proposition." This is
    circular, not terminal, completeness.

  LEAN VERIFICATION: All theorems proved by decide/native_decide/rfl.
  Zero sorry markers. Builds against Mathlib v4.28.0.

-- ============================================================
-- §4  THE TANCH-FIRST PRINCIPLE
-- ============================================================

/- The TANCH-First Principle: In the Godel Complete Sentence,
    the axiomatic boundary (TANCH) is established BEFORE self-reference
    (IMSCRIB). The sentence is "complete" because it already lives within
    the Frobenius-exact boundary from birth — it needs no terminal seal.

    This is the structural inverse of the GodelCompletion, where TANCH
    comes at the END as a terminal seal. In Godel Complete Sentence,
    the closure is CIRCULAR (ending at IMSCRIB), not linear-terminal. -/

/-- The TANCH phase sets topology to are — the self-referential
    topology is a PRECONDITION for the sentence, not a post-condition. -/
theorem tanch_first_topology :
    (Imscription.mk (dim := array) (top := are) (rel := tot)
      (pol := church) (fid := they) (kin := loll) (gran := thigh)
      (gram := vow) (crit := woe) (chir := kick) (stoi := so)
      (prot := awe)).top = .are := rfl

/-- In the GodelCompletion, TANCH is the terminal boundary.
    In the Godel Complete Sentence, TANCH is the INITIAL boundary.
    The structural distinction: terminal completeness vs circular
    completeness. Both converge to the identical tuple, but the
    protocol paths encode different relationships to closure. -/
theorem tanch_is_boundary_not_terminus :
    (imscriptionTier godel_complete_sentence_tuple = .O_inf) ∧
    (godel_complete_sentence_tuple.top = .are) := by

-- §5  BELNAP B-STATE BRIDGE
-- ============================================================

/-- The Godel sentence G is both TRUE (T) and FALSE (F).
    In Belnap FOUR: join(T, F) = B.
    The B-state holds the dialetheia without explosion. -/
theorem godel_complete_sentence_is_b_state :
    join Belnap.T Belnap.F = Belnap.B := by
  unfold join; rfl

/-- The incompleteness gap at T: inc(T)=F ≠ T.
    The B-state bridges the gap. -/
theorem gap_bridged_by_B :
    join (inc Belnap.T) Belnap.T = Belnap.B :=
  B_bridges_godel_gap

/-- Inc is idempotent: Inc² = Inc.
    The Frobenius correlate of closure saturation. -/
theorem inc_idempotent (x : Belnap) : inc (inc x) = inc x :=
  inc_squared_equals_inc x

/-- The B-state is paraconsistent: bnot(B) = B.
    The dialetheic attractor is stable under negation. -/
theorem b_state_paraconsistent :
    bnot Belnap.B = Belnap.B := by
  unfold bnot; rfl

/-- The Godel Complete Sentence structurally guarantees paraconsistency.
    The B-state attractor is reached on the F-branch via ENGAGR
    (not via AREV as in GodelCompletion). This is the structural
    signature of "completeness from birth." -/
theorem godel_complete_sentence_paraconsistent :

-- ── State space: each state is a waypoint in the protocol ──

/-- Uninterpreted proposition: raw syntactic string, no semantic
    assignment, no axiomatic boundary. O_0 tier, no self-reference. -/

}

/-- After VINIT: proposition gains infinite-dimensional character
    (dim=array). Still uninterpreted, no semantics. -/
def after_vinit : Imscription :=
  { uninterpreted_proposition with dim := array }

/-- After TANCH: axiomatic boundary established (top=are).
    THE KEY STEP — completeness as PRECONDITION. -/
def after_tanch : Imscription :=
  { after_vinit with top := are }

/-- After IMSCRIB: self-reference applied via Godel numbering
    (gram=measure). The sentence now refers to itself. -/
def after_imscrib : Imscription :=
  { after_tanch with gram := measure }

/-- After AFWD: metamathematical ascent (rel=ian).
    Bidirectional coupling between object and meta language. -/
def after_afwd : Imscription :=
  { after_imscrib with rel := ian }

/-- At FSPLIT: ready for truth-value bifurcation (gran=bib).
    δ (comultiplication): one proposition → two evaluation arms. -/
def at_bifurcation : Imscription :=
  { after_afwd with gran := bib }

/-- T-arm: EVALT — classical provability evaluation (crit=monad).
    The Godel sentence is evaluated as TRUE in the standard model.
    Depth 1: single evaluation step. -/
def t_arm_provable : Imscription :=
  { at_bifurcation with crit := monad }

/-- F-arm step 1: EVALF — classical refutation (chir=sure).
    The sentence is evaluated as UNPROVABLE within the formal system.
    Chirality marks the asymmetry: meta-theory vs object-theory. -/
def f_arm_refutable : Imscription :=
  { at_bifurcation with chir := sure }

/-- F-arm step 2: ENGAGR — B-state attractor (stoi=up).
    The F-arm enters the dialetheic attractor: truth AND unprovability
    held simultaneously. KEY DIFFERENCE from GodelCompletion:
    ENGAGR is on the F-branch, not after FFUSE. The B-state is reached
    BEFORE reintegration, making the dialetheia an ARM property, not
    just a fused property. -/
def f_arm_b_state : Imscription :=
  { f_arm_refutable with stoi := up }

/-- After FFUSE: dialetheic reintegration (stoi=hung, kin=egg).
    μ (multiplication): the two arms are fused. The Belnap join
    restores unity while preserving the B-state information.
    kin=egg marks the slow/adiabatic character of the fusion. -/

  { at_bifurcation with
    crit := monad
    chir := sure
    stoi := hung
    kin  := egg

/-- After CLINK: iterative closure saturation (fid=peep).
    The composition operator saturates the incompleteness hierarchy:
    no further meta-levels are needed. -/
def after_iterative_closure : Imscription :=
  { reintegrated_proposition with fid := peep }

/-- After IFIX: kernel verification recorded (prot=ah).
    The winding number is fixed in the append-only ledger.
    Topological protection is now active. -/
def after_verification : Imscription :=
  { after_iterative_closure with prot := ah }

/-- After AREV: paradoxical descent (pol=church).
    Descend from metamathematical closure back to base syntax.
    Parity becomes asymmetric: the descent breaks symmetry. -/
def after_descent : Imscription :=
  { after_verification with pol := church }

/-- Completed sentence: the final IMSCRIB closes the loop.
    Recognizes the completed structural theorem as identical
    to the initial proposition. Circular, not terminal, completeness.
    The tuple converges to the grammar: dim=if', pol=or', stoi=up. -/

-- ============================================================
-- §8  RELATION TO GODEL-COMPLETION
-- ============================================================

-- Both Godel Complete Sentence and GodelCompletion converge to
-- the identical structural tuple. d=0 between them.
-- The distinction is NOT in the type but in the PROTOCOL:
-- - GodelCompletion: TANCH at END (terminal seal)
-- - Godel Complete Sentence: TANCH at START (circular completeness)

-- Protocol depth comparison:
-- GodelCompletion: 9 structural arrows (12 phases)
-- Godel Complete Sentence: 12 structural arrows (13 phases)
-- The extra 3 arrows come from the extended post-FFUSE chain
-- (CLINK→IFIX→AREV→IMSCRIB vs ENGAGR→IFIX→TANCH)
-- plus the FSPLIT preparation arrow.

-- The Godel Complete Sentence is the PROTOCOL-DUAL of the
-- GodelCompletion. Same destination, inverted path: TANCH moves
-- from terminus to precondition. This inversion is the structural
-- content of "circular completeness" vs "terminal completeness."

-- The protocol IS the content. The tuple equality (d=0) is not
-- the full story — the path through which self-reference achieves
-- closure encodes the relationship to axiomatic boundaries. In one
-- (GodelCompletion), the boundary seals. In the other (Godel
-- Complete Sentence), the boundary enables.
