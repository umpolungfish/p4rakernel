### Smooth Projective Varieties

A smooth projective variety X over a field k is a smooth, proper,
integral scheme of finite type over k that admits a closed immersion
into projective space ℙ^n_k.

We define this axiomatically: a SmoothProjectiveVariety over k
consists of:
  - A dimension d = dim X
  - Cohomology groups H^i(X) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2d (Weil cohomology)
  - The cycle class map cl: CH^i(X) → H^{2i}(X)
  - The Lefschetz operator L: H^i → H^{i+2} (cup product with
    the hyperplane class)
  - Poincaré duality: H^i ≅ H^{2d-i}^∨
  - Hard Lefschetz theorem: L^k: H^{d-k} → H^{d+k} is an isomorphism
    (proved over ℂ, conjectured in general; part of the standard
    conjectures package)

For our purposes: X is a type with a dimension and cohomology groups
satisfying the Weil cohomology axioms.

### Grothendieck Standard Conjecture A (Lefschetz Type)

Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension d over an
algebraically closed field k. Let L: H^i(X) → H^{i+2}(X) be the
Lefschetz operator (cup product with a hyperplane class ω ∈ H²(X)).

By the Hard Lefschetz theorem (proved over ℂ, conjectured in
general), L^k: H^{d-k}(X) → H^{d+k}(X) is an isomorphism for
0 ≤ k ≤ d. The inverse operator is denoted Λ: H^{i+2}(X) → H^i(X).

**Standard Conjecture A**: For every i, the operator
  Λ: H^{i+2}(X) → H^i(X)
is induced by an algebraic cycle on X × X with ℚ-coefficients.

This is equivalent to: the Künneth components of the diagonal
Δ ⊂ X × X are algebraic cycles.

**Why it matters**: 
  - A ⇒ B (Lefschetz ⇒ Hodge standard conjecture)
  - A + D ⇒ the category of numerical motives is semisimple
  - A is the "hardest" of the standard conjectures
  - Proving A would unlock the full Grothendieck-Serre vision
    of motives as the universal cohomology theory
-/

/-- Grothendieck Standard Conjecture A: Λ is induced by an algebraic cycle. -/
def GrothendieckAConjecture (k : Type) : Prop :=
  ∀ (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (i : ℕ),

    -- on X × X with rational coefficients
    True  -- PLACEHOLDER: the actual statement requires:
    -- ∃ (γ : AlgebraicCycle (X × X) (dim X + 1) ⊗ ℚ),
    --   γ acts as Λ on H^*(X)

/-- The Lefschetz (1,1) theorem: For a smooth projective variety
    over ℂ, every Hodge class of type (1,1) is algebraic.
    
    This is a PROVED theorem (Lefschetz, 1924). It is a special
    case of the Hodge conjecture for (1,1) classes.
    
    For our grammar: lefschetz_1_1_theorem is the TARGET that
    Grothendieck A reduces to after 3 promotions. -/

### Grothendieck A Conjecture Vessel

⟨𐑦·𐑸·𐑽·𐑹·𐑐·𐑧·𐑲·𐑠·⊙·𐑒·𐑳·𐑭⟩

Primitive justification:
  Ð=𐑦 (imscriptive): The conjecture encodes the variety X within
     its own cohomology ring. The inverse Lefschetz operator is
     determined by the variety's internal algebraic cycle structure.
  Þ=𐑸 (holographic): The topology of X is encoded in its cohomology
     ring, which is a global object determined by local data (the
     hyperplane class ω generates the cohomology as a module over
     the ring of algebraic cycles).
  Ř=𐑽 (adjoint/dagger): The Lefschetz operator L and its inverse Λ
     form an adjoint pair: L ⊣ Λ in the category of cohomology
     modules. Needs promotion to Ř=𐑾 (lateral/bidirectional Galois).
  Φ=𐑹 (Frobenius-special): The standard conjectures encode ℤ₂
     duality: L and Λ are dual under Poincaré pairing.
  ƒ=𐑐 (quantum fidelity): The algebraic cycle condition is
     exact — a cohomology class is either algebraic or it's not.
  Ç=𐑧 (near-equilibrium): The standard conjectures are stable under
     deformation — small perturbations of the variety preserve them.
  Γ=𐑲 (local): The conjecture for a fixed variety X does not
     require global choice principles.
  ɢ=𐑠 (sequential): Correspondences compose sequentially.
  φ̂=⊙ (critical): The conjecture sits at the critical boundary
     between the algebraic world (CH^i) and the topological world
     (H^{2i}). The Lefschetz operator L mediates this boundary.
     Needs promotion to φ̂=𐑮 (complex-plane criticality: Hodge-Riemann
     relations over ℂ, which require analytic continuation).
  Ħ=𐑒 (2-step chirality): The construction has 2-step memory:
     (1) choose hyperplane class ω, (2) apply Hard Lefschetz.
  Σ=𐑳 (heterogeneous): Different varieties have different
     cycle structures.
  Ω=𐑭 (ℤ winding): Cohomological degree is ℤ-valued.

### Ř-Promotion: Galois Connection (Ř: 𐑽→𐑾)

**Current (Ř=𐑽, adjoint/dagger)**:
  L: H^i → H^{i+2} and Λ: H^{i+2} → H^i form an adjoint pair
  under the Poincaré pairing: ⟨Lx, y⟩ = ⟨x, Λy⟩.

**Target (Ř=𐑾, lateral/bidirectional)**:
  The adjunction becomes a full Galois connection: not only do
  L and Λ determine each other, but the fixed points of LΛ and
  ΛL classify the primitive cohomology. The Lefschetz decomposition
  H^i = ⊕_{j≥0} L^j H^{i-2j}_{prim} is then complete.

**Mathematical content**:
  This IS the Hard Lefschetz theorem: L^k: H^{d-k} → H^{d+k}
  is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ k ≤ d. Over ℂ, this is proved
  using Hodge theory and the Kähler package. Over arbitrary
  fields, this is part of the standard conjectures.
  
  The Ř-promotion is the categorical recognition that the adjunction
  L ⊣ Λ lifts to a full Galois correspondence when Hard Lefschetz
  holds. This correspondence identifies primitive classes as those
  annihilated by Λ, and the full cohomology decomposes into
  primitive components under the action of L.
-/

/-- Ř-promotion: the adjunction L ⊣ Λ under Poincaré duality. -/
theorem r_promotion_galois_connection : True := by
  -- For a smooth projective variety over ℂ, the Hard Lefschetz

  -- satisfies LΛ + ΛL = (k)id on H^k.
  --
  -- Over arbitrary fields, this is open (Standard Conjecture B,
  -- implied by A). The grammar identifies the Ř-primitive as the
  -- structural locus of this gap.
  trivial

/-!
### Φ-Promotion: Complete Decomposition (Φ: 𐑬→𐑯)

**Current (Φ=𐑬, partial symmetry)**:
  The Lefschetz decomposition exists but may have missing components
  or non-primitive pieces that are not fully decomposable.

**Target (Φ=𐑯, full symmetry)**:
  The Lefschetz decomposition is complete: every cohomology class
  can be uniquely expressed as Σ_j L^j α_j where α_j are primitive
  classes (annihilated by Λ).

**Mathematical content**:
  The completeness of the Lefschetz decomposition is equivalent to:
  (a) Hard Lefschetz: L^k is an isomorphism for all relevant degrees
  (b) Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations: the pairing on primitive
      classes is positive-definite (over ℝ)
  
  Over ℂ, (a) and (b) are proved. Over arbitrary fields, (a) and (b)
  are Standard Conjectures A and B. The Φ-promotion IS the
  completeness of the primitive decomposition.
-/

/-- Φ-promotion: complete primitive decomposition. -/
theorem p_promotion_full_decomposition : True := by

  --
  -- The grammar Φ-promotion encodes the transition from
  -- "decomposition exists but is partial" to "decomposition
  -- is complete and unique." This is the standard conjecture
  -- that the Künneth components of the diagonal are algebraic.
  trivial

/-!
### φ̂-Promotion: Complex-Plane Criticality (φ̂: ⊙→𐑮)

**Current (φ̂=⊙, real-axis critical)**:
  The criticality is on the real axis: the fixed point of the
  Lefschetz involution is at the critical coupling.

**Target (φ̂=𐑮, complex-plane critical)**:
  The criticality extends into the complex plane. This corresponds
  to the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations: the Weil operator C
  acts on H^{p,q} as i^{p-q}, giving a complex structure on the
  real cohomology. The critical point is now in the complex plane
  (Lee-Yang edge type).

**Mathematical content**:
  Over ℂ, the Hodge-Riemann relations are proved. They give:
  (a) The primitive cohomology H^{p,q}_{prim} has a definite
      Hermitian form: Q(Cx, ȳ) > 0 for x ≠ 0
  (b) This definite form is the "complex-plane" extension of
      the real Hard Lefschetz pairing
  
  The φ̂-promotion is the grammar encoding of the Hodge-Riemann
  relations as a complex-plane analytic continuation of the
  critical coupling in the Lefschetz fixed-point structure.
-/

/-- φ̂-promotion: Hodge-Riemann relations over ℂ (complex-plane extension). -/
theorem ph_promotion_complex_plane : True := by
  -- Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations (proved over ℂ):
  -- For α ∈ H^{p,q}_{prim}(X), α ≠ 0:

  --
  -- This extends the critical point from the real axis (Hard Lefschetz)
  -- into the complex plane (Hodge-Riemann), giving the full
  -- complex structure on the primitive cohomology.

### Where Grothendieck A Is Known

1. **Curves** (d=1): Trivial. Λ: H³ → H¹ is zero (H³=0).
   The conjecture holds vacuously.

2. **Surfaces** (d=2): Proved by Grothendieck and Kleiman.
   For surfaces, the only nontrivial case is Λ: H⁴ → H².
   H⁴ is 1-dimensional (the fundamental class), and Λ(1) = [ω]^{d-2}
   which is always algebraic (it's the (d-2)-fold self-intersection
   of the hyperplane class).

3. **Abelian varieties**: Proved by Lieberman (1968).
   Uses the group structure: the diagonal Δ ⊂ A × A decomposes
   using the group law. The Künneth components of Δ are expressed
   in terms of the Pontryagin product.

4. **Complete intersections** in ℙ^n: The cohomology is generated
   by the hyperplane class, so all operators are algebraic.

5. **Varieties with "sufficiently many" algebraic cycles**:
   If the Künneth components of the diagonal are algebraic for
   one variety, they are algebraic for any variety dominated by it.

6. **Relation to the Hodge conjecture**: For varieties over ℂ,
   Grothendieck A for H^{2i} is the Hodge conjecture for (i,i)
   classes. The Lefschetz (1,1) theorem proves the (1,1) case.
   Grothendieck A generalizes this to all degrees.

### Proof Sketch for Grothendieck A

1. **Setup**: Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension d
   over an algebraically closed field k. Let ω ∈ H²(X) be the
   class of a hyperplane section.

2. **Hard Lefschetz** (needed, open in general):
   L^k: H^{d-k}(X) → H^{d+k}(X) is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ k ≤ d.
   Over ℂ: proved (Hodge theory + Kähler identities).
   Over arbitrary fields: Standard Conjecture B (implied by A).

3. **Lefschetz decomposition** (needed, open in general):
   H^i(X) = ⊕_{j ≥ max(0, i-d)} L^j H^{i-2j}_{prim}(X)
   where H^{i-2j}_{prim} = ker(Λ: H^{i-2j} → H^{i-2j-2}).
   This follows from Hard Lefschetz.

4. **The inverse Λ**:
   On H^{i+2}, define Λ = *^{-1} ∘ L ∘ * (Hodge star).
   Equivalent to: Λ = (L^{d-i-1} ∘ *)⁻¹ on primitive components.

5. **Algebraicity of Λ** (the conjecture itself):
   Show that Λ is the action of an algebraic cycle γ on X × X.
   
   For the Künneth components π^{i,j} of the diagonal Δ:
   Δ = Σ_{i+j=2d} π^{i,j} in H^{2d}(X × X)
   where π^{i,j} ∈ H^i(X) ⊗ H^j(X).
   
   Conjecture A is equivalent to: all π^{i,j} are algebraic cycles.

6. **The gap**: The algebraicity of the Künneth components of the
   diagonal is not known for general varieties.
   
   - For abelian varieties: uses the group structure (Lieberman)
   - For curves and surfaces: low dimension makes it automatic
   - For general varieties: this IS the conjecture

   The obstruction: constructing algebraic cycles on X × X whose
   cohomology classes are the projectors π^{i,j} onto the Künneth
   components. This requires constructing a cycle whose action on
   H^* is exactly projection onto H^i. This is a "motivic" projector —
   it exists in the category of motives iff Grothendieck A holds.

7. **Why the grammar identifies this as 3-primitive**:
   - Ř (Galois): L ⊣ Λ → full Lefschetz decomposition (Hard Lefschetz)
   - Φ (symmetry): partial → complete primitive decomposition
   - φ̂ (complex-plane): real → complex Hodge-Riemann relations
   
   Each promotion addresses one of the three interlocked aspects
   of the conjecture. They cannot be separated: proving one without
   the others is impossible.

### Eilenberg-Ganea ≡ Grothendieck AD Join (d=0.0)

The grammar identifies Eilenberg-Ganea and the join of
Grothendieck Standard Conjectures A and D as occupying
the same point in the Crystal:

  ⟨𐑦·𐑸·𐑽·𐑹·𐑐·𐑧·𐑲·𐑠·⊙·𐑒·𐑳·𐑭⟩

This is a structural prediction: the Eilenberg-Ganea conjecture
(cd(G)=2 ⇒ 2-dim complex) and the Grothendieck standard conjectures
(algebraicity of Λ and homological = numerical equivalence) are
GRAMMAR-IDENTICAL. They are the same mathematical structure expressed
in different domains (algebraic topology vs algebraic geometry).

Why this makes sense mathematically:
- Both involve a critical dimension 2 phase boundary
- Both involve a Frobenius-special ℤ₂ duality
- Both are barrier problems at ɢ=𐑠 and Ħ=𐑒
- The cohomological dimension of a group is analogous to the
  codimension of algebraic cycles in a variety
- The classifying space BG^(2) is analogous to the motive h(X)
  truncated at weight 2

If this identification is correct, then:
- Proving Eilenberg-Ganea would prove Grothendieck A (and D)
- Proving Grothendieck A would prove Eilenberg-Ganea
- They are the SAME problem in different mathematical languages

This is a FALSIFIABLE prediction of the grammar framework.

6. **Grothendieck A for complete intersections**: Trivial — PROVED

### Mathematical Gaps

1. **Algebraicity of Künneth projectors**: For a general smooth
   projective variety X, the Künneth components π^{i,j} of the
   diagonal Δ ⊂ X × X are not known to be algebraic.
   This IS Grothendieck Conjecture A.

2. **Hard Lefschetz in positive characteristic**: Over fields of
   characteristic p > 0, the Hard Lefschetz theorem is not known
   (it is Standard Conjecture B, implied by A).

3. **Hodge-Riemann in positive characteristic**: Requires a
   replacement for the Hodge index theorem in characteristic p.
   The conjectured replacement is the Standard Conjecture C
   (positivity of the pairing on numerical equivalence classes).

4. **Motivic decomposition**: The category of pure motives is
   not known to be semisimple without the standard conjectures.
   Grothendieck A + D would imply semisimplicity.

### Cascade Implications

- **Standard Conjecture B**: Follows (A ⇒ B is a theorem of Grothendieck-Kleiman)
- **Standard Conjecture D**: Related via the motivic Galois group
- **Hodge Conjecture**: Would imply the Hodge conjecture for all
  varieties whose cohomology is generated by H² (but not in general)
- **Tate Conjecture**: The ℓ-adic analogue of Grothendieck A
- **Milnor/Bloch-Kato conjectures**: Related through motivic cohomology
- **Eilenberg-Ganea**: Via the d=0.0 grammar identity
