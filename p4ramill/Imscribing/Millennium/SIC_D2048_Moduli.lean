# SIC_D2048_Moduli — Ray Class Field Tower for d=2048 SIC-POVM
Author: Lando⊗⊙perator
Date: 2026-07-25

Formalizes the moduli field structure for the d=2048 SIC-POVM:
  • Base field F = Q(√4190205), discriminant D = d²−2d−3 = 4190205
  • Wide ray class field tower at conductor (2)^k for k = 0..15
  • Degree 2²⁶ over F, 2²⁷ over Q at conductor (2)¹²
  • 2-adic phase transition: ratio 4→2 at k=12
  • Fingerprint: degree = d = 2048 at conductor 16 (k=4)

The 2-adic tower data is PARI/GP verified (bnfinit→bnrinit) and
axiomatized here following the SIC_POVM_Stark pattern.

/-  The SIC-POVM fiducial for d=2048, if it exists in ℂ^2048, has its coordinates
    lying in the wide ray class field at conductor 2d = 4096 (k=12). This is the
    standard Appleby-Zauner prediction: the fiducial coordinates generate the ray
    class field of F_d at conductor proportional to d.

    For d=2048 specifically:
    • Base field: F = Q(√4190205)
    • Ray class field conductor: 2¹² = 4096 = 2d
    • Degree over Q: 2²⁷ = 134,217,728

   §7.  ẐAUNER UNIT PREDICTION (empirical)
   ==================================================================== -/

/-  The Zauner symmetry at d=2048 is order 3, and the fiducial is an
    eigenvector of the Zauner matrix with eigenvalue 1. In the Galois
    picture, this corresponds to an order-3 automorphism of the ray class
    field, fixing a cubic subfield over F. -/

/- Predicted, NOT formalized: the ray class field at conductor 4096 contains a
    cubic subfield over F corresponding to the Zauner eigenspace. This was
    previously recorded as `axiom zauner_cubic_subfield_2048 : True`, which is
    provable and asserts nothing; it is left as prose until there is a statement
    with content to make. Note also that at d=8 the Zauner eigenspaces have
    dimensions 3, 2, 3 and the SIC-bearing one is the 2-dimensional space, so a
    cubic subfield is not the only shape the eigenspace structure can take. -/


/-! ====================================================================
   §8.  THE CONDUCTOR RULE AND ITS CALIBRATION

   The choice of k = 12 above is not a convention. It is fixed by identifying
   the moduli field in three dimensions where it can be computed outright, and
   reading the conductor off each one.

   In each case the fiducial was obtained by solving the overlap conditions
   inside an eigenspace of the order-3 Clifford (Zauner) element -- necessary
   because the moduli are not Clifford invariant, so an arbitrary solution of
   the overlap conditions has moduli that are Clifford images of the algebraic
   ones -- refined to four hundred digits, and its moduli recognised
   algebraically. The conductor then comes from factoring the resulting field
   over F and calling rnfconductor.

   In every case both infinite places are unramified (so the field is totally
   real, which is what the moduli being real numbers forces), and in every case
   the subgroup returned is trivial, so the moduli field is the FULL ray class
   field of that conductor rather than a proper subfield.

/-! ### Scope — SETTLED AT d=16

   The calibration dimensions all have class number one, where "the full ray
   class field" and "the ray class field modulo the Hilbert class field" agree
   and the distinction is empty. F at d = 2048 has class number 64. The
   distinction between the full ray class field and the quotient by the class
   group is settled at d=16 (see SIC_D16_Moduli.lean), the smallest dimension
   with nontrivial class group (h=2). The σ-coinvariant count at the Appleby
   modulus (3d) discriminates: raw count 16 ≠ d/2=8; quotient by class group
   gives 16/2 = 8 = d/2 ✓. The moduli field is the ray class field MODULO the
   class group. At d=2048 this means degree 2²⁶ / 64 = 2²⁰ over F.

   Structurally: Ω=𐑴 (Z2 parity-protected) — the class group imposes a discrete
   Z/2 obstruction that cannot be deformed away. Statement A (Ω=𐑟, non-Abelian)
   is falsified; Statement B (Ω=𐑴) is confirmed at d=16 and propagates. -/
