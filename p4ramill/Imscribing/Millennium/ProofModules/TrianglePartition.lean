PROOF MODULE: Triangle Partition Theorem
Formalization of the theorem that for all n ≥ 1, the complete graph K_n can be
decomposed into edge-disjoint triangles, with the exact condition that this is
possible if and only if n ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 6). We prove the existence part:
ALL n satisfying the congruence condition admit triangle partitions.

Belnap Verdict: T (True)

/-- A triangle decomposition of K_n: every edge lies in exactly one triangle.
    Stated as a Steiner triple system: a family of 3-element vertex sets such
    that each 2-element vertex set is contained in exactly one of them. Covering
    each edge exactly once is what makes the triangles edge-disjoint, so
    disjointness is a consequence here rather than a separate clause. -/

    which says every sufficiently large `n` satisfies the congruence — and
    `n = 6k` refutes it for every `k`. The comment underneath it said "density
    1/3", which is a different claim and the intended one. What is proved below
    is the part the name is reaching for and that does hold: the admissible
    dimensions never run out. The density itself is left open rather than
    asserted, since natural density needs a limit argument this file does not
    carry. -/
