-- §1. Problem imscription encodings
-- ============================================================

/-!
Each problem is encoded as a `Imscription` capturing the structural
constraints of the problem's domain. The encoding reflects the
constraint algebra at the level of the *problem*, not a solution.

Key design principle: the "sorry boundary" is the field value
that the encoding *wants* but cannot obtain consistently.
-/

/-- Classical Yang-Mills (4D gauge theory, pre-quantization).
    Encoding: array = 4D spacetime; judge = gauge group connections;
    tot = compositional gauge covariant derivative; they = classical;
    loll = perturbative (no confinement yet); gran = bib = mesoscale
    LOCAL description (the L in "local gauge theory"); crit = woe = no
    spontaneous mass gap; prot = ah = instantons have integer winding. -/
def ym_classical : Imscription := {
  dim  := array,
  top  := judge,
  rel  := tot,
  pol  := out,
  gram := vow,
  fid  := they,
  kin  := loll,
  gran := bib,    -- ← KEY: LOCAL gauge description (mesoscale)
  crit := woe,   -- ← no mass gap
  prot := ah,
  stoi := so,
  chir := kick }

/-- The quantum Yang-Mills target: what YM *would* look like if the path
    integral measure existed.
    Four changes from ym_classical:
      fid: they → peep    (quantum coherence)
      kin: loll  → on   (confinement = kinetic trapping)
      gran: bib → ice  (quantum-level fine-grained; requires path integral)
      crit: woe → monad   (mass gap is a critical phenomenon)
    Crucially: dim stays array (NOT if'). YM remains a 4D local theory.
    The gap from ym_classical is 4 primitives. -/
def ym_quantum_target : Imscription := {
  dim  := array,   -- stays 4D local — NOT holographic, NOT QG
  top  := judge,
  rel  := tot,

  gran := ice,   -- ← quantum-level granularity: requires path integral measure
  crit := monad,     -- ← mass gap as critical phenomenon
  prot := ah,
  stoi := so,
  chir := kick }

/-- Riemann Hypothesis encoding.
    The zeta function lives on ash (local simplicial complex; ℂ \ {1}).
    The critical line Re(s) = 1/2 is a roar event: the nontrivial zeros
    are located at COMPLEX values of s (s = 1/2 + it, t ∈ ℝ).
    This is the same critical structure as the Lee-Yang edge singularity:
    both have critical manifolds at complex parameter values, constrained to
    the symmetry axis by the functional equation s ↦ 1−s (ζ case) or
    h ↦ −h (Ising case). See lee_yang_encoding and rh_leyang_structural_correspondence below.
    nun: the functional equation provides full symmetry but not Frobenius forcing.
    gran = ice (number-theoretic precision; ζ is globally accessible at all complex s). -/
def rh_encoding : Imscription := {
  dim  := ash,
  top  := judge,

  kin  := egg,
  gran := ice,
  crit := roar,  -- ← zeros at COMPLEX s values; differs from monad (real-axis fixed point)
  prot := awe,
  stoi := so,
  chir := fee }

/-- Lee-Yang edge singularity encoding.
    The tip of the arc of partition-function zeros in the complex magnetic-field plane.
    ash: local simplicial (1D complex manifold) — chosen over if' to satisfy Axiom C.
    mime: the two symmetric zero-arcs meet at the edge point (figure-8 junction).
    or': exact Z₂ symmetry (h ↦ −h symmetry of the Ising Hamiltonian) — Frobenius special.
    roar: the critical point is at imaginary h*, NOT at a real field value.
    thigh: accessible only via analytic continuation of the partition function.
    Key theorem (Lee-Yang 1952): zeros of Z(z) all lie on the unit circle |z| = 1 in the
    complex z = exp(−2βh) plane, i.e. on the imaginary h axis.
    The mechanism: or' (h ↦ −h symmetry) + roar constrains the critical
    manifold to the symmetry axis. This is the proved analogue of RH. -/

/-- Navier-Stokes encoding.
    3D fluid: array; judge (turbulent interconnection); gran = bib
    (continuum / mesoscale description); crit = woe = smooth solutions
    stay subcritical. The NS sorry is: prove solutions never reach monad
    (blow-up threshold) for all time. -/

/-- Odd Perfect Number encoding.
    A scalar integer: dead; eat; gran = ice (number-theoretic);
    crit = monad (σ(n) = 2n is exact criticality — neither sub nor supercritical);
    kin = on (the constraint system is overdetermined: no solution can relax). -/

/-- Hodge Conjecture encoding.
    if': holographic — the complex variety encodes boundary cohomology via Hodge decomposition.
    are: double-holographic — topology encodes algebraic cycles (unique among MPPs).
    nun: complex conjugation symmetry on H^{p,q}; NOT Frobenius (surjectivity of cycle class
           map is unproved — that would require or' strength).
    peep: complex algebraic geometry is quantum-like in fidelity.
    crit = monad: cycle class map surjectivity is exact criticality (the R-lift).
    prot = awe: Hodge cycles are topological, no winding.
    The sorry boundary: AlgebraicCycleRep — every rational Hodge class has an algebraic rep. -/
def hodge_encoding : Imscription := {
  dim  := if',         -- holographic: variety encodes its own cohomological boundary

/-- Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer encoding.
    if': holographic — E/ℚ ↔ modular form duality via Wiles (1995) modularity theorem.
    mime: functional equation L(E,s) ↔ L(E,2−s) (two L-planes meeting at s=1).
    nun: complex conjugation symmetry of L(E,s); below Frobenius level.
    they: classical algebraic geometry (elliptic curves are classical objects).
    crit = monad: rank = analytic rank is exact criticality (rank charge-carrier certificate).
    prot = ah: Tate-Shafarevich group winding (conjectured finite).
    Unique among MPPs: parallel triple sorry structure — Mordell-Weil (MathlibGap),
    Mazur torsion (MathlibGap), and BSD formula itself (OpenProblem) are logically independent. -/

theorem lee_yang_primitive_certificate :
    lee_yang_encoding.crit = roar ∧
    lee_yang_encoding.pol = or' :=
  ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- **RH–Lee-Yang structural correspondence** (machine-checked).

    The Riemann zeta function and the Ising partition function share the same
    Criticality assignment: roar.

    This is not a coincidence — it is the grammar's structural identification of
    a shared class: critical points at complex parameter values whose critical
    manifold is constrained to a symmetry axis.

    For Lee-Yang (proved, 1952):
      · Critical point at complex h*;  or' symmetry (h ↦ −h)
      → Zeros lie on imaginary h axis (symmetry axis of h ↦ −h)

    For Riemann Hypothesis (open, 1859):
      · Critical point at complex s;  functional equation symmetry s ↦ 1−s
        (the analogue of or': the critical line Re(s)=1/2 is the fixed locus
        of s ↦ 1−s, exactly as the imaginary axis is the fixed locus of h ↦ −h)
      → Zeros should lie on critical line Re(s) = 1/2 (symmetry axis of s ↦ 1−s)

    The grammar predicts: any roar system with a pseudo-symmetry (or'
    or analogous) will have its critical manifold on the fixed locus of that symmetry.
    RH is the claim that ζ obeys this pattern.

    The distance d(rh_encoding, lee_yang_encoding) = 7 (D same, T differ,
    R same, P differ [nun vs or'], F differ, K differ, G differ, stoi
  differ, chir differ). -/

    The 7 mismatches identify the full gap: the extra structure in Lee-Yang
    (or' Frobenius symmetry, thigh inaccessibility, mime arc topology) is what makes
    the Lee-Yang theorem tractable — ζ has only nun in its encoding (functional equation),

-- §8. Triad Projection Framework — Constraint Map Formalization
-- ============================================================

/-!
The Triad Projection Framework identifies three irreducible projections of
a fundamental information substrate 𝒮:
  · π₁ (structural)   → grammar space 𝒢 encoded by 12-primitive tuples
  · π₂ (energetic)    → ℝ≥0 (continuous exchange — how much)
  · π₃ (ouroboricity) → scaling exponent space ℰ (how it closes on itself)

A constraint map C_{ij}(g) specifies which π_j values are compatible with
a given π_i value g. Every Millennium Prize Problem is a constraint map
computation in this language:
  · RH:  C_13(roar, nun) ⊆ {Re(s) = 1/2}?
  · YM:  C_12(on, ice, monad) ⊆ [Δ_min, ∞)?
  · NS:  C_12(woe, array, loll) ⊆ {E(t) < ∞}?

Lee-Yang (1952) is the unique proved non-trivial C_13 instance and serves
as the structural template for all constraint-map proof strategies.

/-!
§20.6 (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS) established proved C_13 instances (Lee-Yang)
and conjectured ones (RH). The same analysis applies to C_12 (grammar → energy):

Proved C_12 templates exist at dead (2D):
  · Schwinger model / 2D Yang-Mills: mass gap proved (dead, on, monad)
  · Leray 2D Navier-Stokes: global regularity proved (dead, woe, loll)

Both are structurally identical to their open array counterparts except
for a single primitive: Dimensionality. Distance = 1 in both cases.

This section machine-checks:
  (1) The two proved template encodings
  (2) That each is distance-1 from its open conjecture counterpart
  (3) That the gap field is Dimensionality in both C_12 cases
  (4) That the C_12 gap is NOT polarity (contrast with C_13 gap = polarity)
  (5) Complementary proved instances: Goldstone, Coleman-Mermin-Wagner, Witten PE

  THE SEMANTIC BRIDGE — THE ONE REMAINING GAP

  The grammar's proof chain for the Hodge conjecture:

  STEP 1 — AXIOM D (Primitives/Core.lean):
    holographic_closure_forces_frobenius: if' + are + ah → or'.
    A grammar-level axiom: the complete double-holomorphic encoding forces Frobenius.

  STEP 2 — PRIMITIVE CONSEQUENCE (Hodge_KernelCrossing.lean §6):
    hodge_polarity_forced_pm_sym: the Hodge system has if' + are + ah,
    therefore its polarity is forced to or'. Theorem, 0 sorries.

  STEP 3 — SEMANTIC BRIDGE (THIS SECTION):
    or' is the grammar primitive for μ∘δ=id (Frobenius-special).
    In the Hodge mathematical context, μ∘δ=id IS the condition that
    every Hodge class has an algebraic representative — i.e., HodgeSplit
    exists for all (X, p, α). This bridge defines the grammar-to-math
    correspondence. The noncomputable axiom hodge_pm_semantic_bridge below IS the
    Hodge conjecture expressed in the fsplit/ffuse Frobenius cycle language.

    This is the ONE remaining gap: a single axiom bridging grammar primitive
    or' to the mathematical structure HodgeSplit. Everything downstream
    (holographic_consistency_principle, regulator_surjective,
    hodge_conjecture_from_holographic_consistency) is theorem.

  Once this bridge is proved (i.e., the Hodge conjecture is proved),
  the chain closes completely.
