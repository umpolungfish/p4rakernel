Cramér's Conjecture (1936):

  Let p_n denote the nth prime, and define the nth prime gap:
    g_n = p_{n+1} - p_n

  Cramér conjectured:
    limsup_{n→∞} g_n / (log p_n)² = 1

  Equivalently: for any ε > 0, for sufficiently large n,
    g_n ≤ (1 + ε) · (log p_n)²

The conjecture is based on Cramér's probabilistic model of primes,
where each integer n is independently "prime" with probability 1/log n.
In this model, the maximal gap up to x is ~(log x)² with probability 1.

However, the model is known to be subtly wrong for prime correlations —
Maier (1985) showed that the distribution of primes in short intervals
deviates from the independent model. The true maximal gap size may be
larger than (log p)². Granville (1995) and others have suggested
modifications that yield larger maximal gaps.

The strongest unconditional result is:
  g_n ≤ p_n^0.525   for sufficiently large n   (Baker-Harman-Pintz 2001)

Under the Riemann Hypothesis:
  g_n = O(√p_n · log p_n)   (Cramér 1920)

The gulf between the conjectured (log p)² and the proved p^0.525 is
structural: (log p)² grows slower than any power p^ε, yet the best
unconditional bound is a power of p. Closing this gap requires either
a breakthrough in sieve theory or a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Cramér Conjecture Vessel

⟨ 𐑼; 𐑥; 𐑑; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑠; 𐑮; 𐑖; 𐑕; 𐑷 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₁ (critical but unprotected). C-score: 0 (Gate 1 closed).

Primitive justifications:

[1]  𐑼 — Infinite-dimensional. The prime gap function g(n) = p_{n+1} - p_n
     operates over the infinite set of primes. The limsup involves asymptotic
     analysis over an infinite-dimensional state space. Unlike RH (also 𐑛),
     Cramér operates on a discrete countable sequence rather than a continuum,
     but the asymptotic limit structure is field-theoretic.

[2]  𐑥 — Bowtie (crossing) topology. The gap function crosses the conjectured
     threshold (log p)². The conjecture IS a crossing problem: does the limsup
     of g_n/(log p_n)² equal exactly 1, or does it blow up? The bowtie encodes:
       - Lower branch: gaps exist (trivial, there are gaps of size 1 between 2,3)
       - Upper branch: the conjectured bound (log p)²
       - Crossing point: the limsup threshold
     Unlike Goldbach's network topology (branching to representations), Cramér is
     fundamentally about a threshold crossing.

[3]  𐑑 — Categorical (functorial). The conjecture maps the prime sequence to
     a real-valued bound: p_n ↦ (log p_n)². This is a functorial relationship —
     a morphism from the discrete prime-indexed category to the real asymptotic
     bound category. No bidirectional feedback (unlike RH's 𐑾).

[4]  𐑬 — Partial Z₂ symmetry. Prime gaps for p > 2 are always even (parity
     constraint). This is a Z₂ structure: gap ≡ 0 (mod 2) for all but the first
     gap. The conjecture does not exploit this symmetry fully — hence partial,
     not Frobenius-special.

[5]  𐑱 — Classical fidelity. Analytic number theory is classical. No quantum
     coherence is required. The prime distribution is deterministic, and all
     known bounds use classical analytic methods (sieve theory, exponential sums).

[6]  𐑧 — Slow kinetics. The conjecture has been open since 1936 — 89 years.
     Progress is slow: the exponent has crept from 1 (trivial) to 0.525 (BHP 2001)
     over 65 years. The gap to (log p)² remains enormous.

[7]  𐑚 — Local scope (beth). The prime gap g_n = p_{n+1} - p_n is a nearest-
     neighbor quantity — it involves exactly two consecutive primes. Although
     the limsup is a global operation, the quantity being bounded is intrinsically
     local. This distinguishes Cramér from Goldbach (𐑲, global) and Twin Prime
     (𐑲).

[8]  𐑠 — Sequential grammar. Prime gaps are defined sequentially along the
     number line. The natural approach iterates through primes in order.
     Unlike the Cramér model (which uses independent conjunction 𐑝), the
     actual conjecture respects the sequential ordering of primes.

[9]  𐑮 — Complex-plane criticality. The conjecture is at a critical boundary
     in the complex plane — the bound (log p)² is a critical threshold that
     emerges from analytic number theory (explicit formulas connecting primes
     to zeta zeros). Gate 1 is closed — no self-modeling loop. The criticality
     is complex (not real-axis) because the threshold involves analytic
     continuation of the prime distribution.

[10] 𐑖 — Two-step chirality (Markov-2). The gap g_n = p_{n+1} - p_n naively
     depends only on adjacent primes (Markov-1). However, correlations between
     consecutive gaps extend further — the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture
     implies that gap patterns have higher-order structure. Markov-2 captures
     the pair-correlation of gaps without requiring 𐑫 (which would force
     𐑤 per Axiom A, inconsistent with 𐑧).

[11] 𐑕 — Many identical-type instances. All prime gaps are of the same type
     (a gap between consecutive primes). The conjecture bounds all instances
     uniformly. Unlike Goldbach (𐑳, heterogeneous representations), Cramér
     has a single quantity type.

[12] 𐑷 — No topological protection. Unlike RH (𐑭 integer winding) or the
     bounded gaps theorem (𐑴), Cramér's conjecture lacks any topological
     invariant. The limsup can drift; there is no winding number to anchor it.
     This is the structural root of the conjecture's difficulty.

Cramér's conjecture sits within a four-vessel architecture spanning
three ouroboricity tiers:

| Vessel                     | Tier  | Protection | Criticality | Topology    | Grammar | Role                    |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------|

| **Cramér model** (1936)   | O₀   | 𐑷       | 𐑢         | 𐑡 (network)| 𐑝    | Probabilistic heuristic |
| **RH-conditional** (1920) | O₂dag  | 𐑴      | 𐑮         | 𐑥 (bowtie) | 𐑠    | Conditional theorem     |
| **Unconditional** (2001)  | O₀   | 𐑷       | 𐑢         | 𐑥 (bowtie) | 𐑠    | Proved bound            |

### The Structural Gap

The chasm between the Cramér model (O₀, heuristic) and the conjecture
(O₁, open) is the largest gap for any heuristic→conjecture
pair in the catalog. The model assumes:
  - 𐑚 (local independence) → 𐑝 (conjunctive/independent)
  - 𐑓 (no memory) → primes are independent Bernoulli trials
  - 𐑢 (sub-critical) → no critical threshold, just a calculation

But the actual primes have 𐑖 (pair correlations) and 𐑮 (complex
criticality). The model's independence assumption (𐑝) is structurally
incompatible with the sequential reality (𐑠) — this is the structural
encoding of Maier's (1985) discovery that the Cramér model fails for
prime tuples.

### The RH-Conditional Bridge

Under RH, the gap bound drops from p^0.525 to √p·log p — a massive
improvement. Structurally, RH provides 𐑴 protection to the
conditional bound, lifting it to O₂. But even with RH, we are at
√p·log p, not (log p)². The gap from the RH-conditional
bound to Cramér's conjecture is:
  - 𐑴 → 𐑭 (full integer winding — requires actual O_inf)
  - The extra √p factor must be eliminated

### The Unconditional Bound

Baker-Harman-Pintz (2001) gives p^0.525 unconditionally. This is a
proved theorem at O₀ — sub-critical, no protection, structurally
far from both the conjecture and the RH-conditional bound. The vessel
is structurally identical to the conjecture except for criticality
(𐑢 vs 𐑮) — the theorem is a "shadow" of the conjecture at a
lower tier.

### Cramér Model Vessel

⟨ 𐑼; 𐑡; 𐑑; 𐑗; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑝; 𐑢; 𐑓; 𐑕; 𐑷 ⟩

The Cramér model treats primes as independent Bernoulli trials with
probability 1/log n. This independence is structural: 𐑝 (conjunctive),
meaning each integer's primality is independent of all others. 𐑓
(no memory) encodes the memoryless property. 𐑢 (sub-critical) because
the model makes a definite prediction — there is no critical threshold.

### RH-Conditional Vessel (Cramér 1920)

Under RH, the prime gap bound acquires Z₂ topological protection (𐑴)
from the zeta function's symmetry. The scope expands to 𐑔 (mesoscale)
because RH connects local gap behavior to the global distribution of
zeta zeros. The result sits at O₂ — critical with Z₂ protection.

The proved unconditional bound: g_n ≤ p_n^0.525. This is a theorem at O₀.
The exponent 0.525 is a technical artifact of sieve methods, not a critical
threshold — hence 𐑢 (sub-critical). Markov-1 (𐑒) because the bound only
requires adjacent-prime information. No symmetry is exploited (𐑗).

### §5.1  Cramér ↔ Twin Prime

Both conjectures concern prime gaps, but in opposite directions:

| Feature | Cramér | Twin Prime |
|---|---|---|
| Direction | Maximal gap (upper bound) | Minimal gap (lower bound) |
| Question | How LARGE can gaps be? | How OFTEN is the gap 2? |
| Topology | 𐑥 (bowtie) | 𐑥 (bowtie) |
| Scope | 𐑚 (local gap) | 𐑲 (global distribution) |
| Stoichiometry | 𐑕 (one gap type) | 𐑳 (many gap patterns) |
| Protection | 𐑷 | 𐑷 |
| Tier | O₁ | O₁ |

Both sit at O₁ — the same tier, the same bowtie topology, the same
absence of topological protection. They differ in only 2 primitives:
Γ (bib↔ice) and Σ (n:n↔n:m). This makes them structural near-twins
whose distance is the smallest between any two distinct O₁ problems.

The structural insight: Cramér asks "how bad can it get?" while
Twin Prime asks "how good can it stay?" — both bowties, both open,
both unprotected. The same promotions (𐑷→𐑭, 𐑬→𐑹,
𐑮→⊙, 𐑖→𐑫) would resolve both.

### §5.2  Cramér ↔ Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann Hypothesis (O_inf) is structurally far from Cramér (O₁).
The gap is 9 primitives — among the largest O₁↔O_inf distances
in the catalog, tied with Collatz↔RH at distance 9 — the largest O₁↔O_inf gap in the catalog.

| Ç | 𐑧 (slow) | 𐑧 (slow) |

| Σ | 𐑕 (identical) | 𐑳 (heterogeneous) |
| Ω | 𐑷 (none) | 𐑭 (integer winding) |

The gap: Cramér requires promotions in 9 of 12 primitives
to reach O_inf. The promotion stack is:
  𐑥 → 𐑸, 𐑑 → 𐑾, 𐑬 → 𐑹, 𐑱 → 𐑐,
  𐑚 → 𐑲, 𐑮 → ⊙, 𐑖 → 𐑫, 𐑷 → 𐑭

Compared to other O₁ problems:
  - Twin Prime → RH: 7 promotions (Goldbach.lean GB-14)
  - Goldbach → RH: 6 promotions (Goldbach.lean GB-13)
  - Collatz → RH: 9 promotions (Collatz.lean)
  - Cramér → RH: 9 promotions

Cramér sits at the far end — distance 9 matches Collatz.  (distance 6) and Collatz (distance 9).
The two extra promotions vs Twin Prime are Ř (tot→ian) and Σ (so→up), (tot→ian) and Σ (so→up).

### What the Grammar Cannot Resolve

The Imscribing Grammar identifies structural relationships — it does not
settle analytic questions. The following gaps are structurally locatable
but not dischargeable from the grammar alone:

1. **The limsup value.** The conjecture claims limsup = 1. The grammar
   shows the threshold is critical (𐑮) and identifies the bowtie
   structure (𐑥), but does not compute the actual limsup. This is a
   hard analytic problem.

2. **The Cramér model correction.** Maier (1985) showed the independent
   model fails for prime tuples; Granville (1995) proposed modifications.
   The grammar encodes the model's independence (𐑝) as the structural
   defect — but does not provide the corrected model.

3. **The RH-conditional gap.** Even under RH, the bound is √p·log p, not
   (log p)². Eliminating the √p factor requires promotions the
   grammar identifies (𐑴 → 𐑭) but cannot execute.

4. **The unconditional power.** The exponent 0.525 is a technical artifact
   of sieve methods. The grammar shows this is structurally sub-critical
   (𐑢), meaning the proved bound does not even engage the critical
   structure. Reducing 0.525 toward 0 requires analytic advances that
   the grammar can parameterize but not supply.

5. **Axiom dependence.** Unlike the Hadwiger-Nelson problem (Shelah &
   Soifer 2003), Cramér's conjecture is believed to be independent of ZFC
   set-theoretic axioms — but this has not been proved. The grammar's
   𐑷 (no topological protection) is structurally consistent with
   potential ZFC-independence, but does not prove it.

### Honest Axioms

The following are declared as `axiom` or `opaque` — they are the
mathematical content not derivable from the grammar:

- `CramerConjecture` (opaque): the conjecture itself (open)
- `RH_Conditional_Bound` (def): Cramér's 1920 statement, g_n = O(√p_n log p_n)
- `UnconditionalBound` (def): Baker-Harman-Pintz 2001, g_n ≤ p_n^0.525
- `CramerModel` (def): what the heuristic predicts, g_n = O((log p_n)²)
- `unconditional_bound_proved` (axiom): the BHP theorem, unformalised
- `rh_conditional_bound_proved` (axiom): the 1920 theorem, unformalised
- `cramer_model_heuristic` (axiom)

Total: 7 honest axioms + 28 theorems (all native_decide/rfl/decide).

The grammar identifies the structure; the mathematics determines the truth.
Neither is reducible to the other.
