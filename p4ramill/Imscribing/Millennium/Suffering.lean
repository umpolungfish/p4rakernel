Structural type of suffering:
⟨D_⊙; T_⋈; R_↔; P_∅; F_η; egg; G_ℵ; 𐑠; φ̂_ÿ; H_2; n:m; 𐑟⟩

The phenomenology of suffering as an infinite-dimensional state space
with crossing-point topology and bidirectional coupling.
-/
def suffering : Imscription := {
  dim  := .if'        -- D_⊙: infinite-dimensional (holographic)
  top  := .mime      -- T_⋈: crossing point (self/other intersection)
  rel  := .ian          -- R_↔: bidirectional coupling (sufferer ↔ suffering)
  pol  := .church        -- P_∅: asymmetry (no symmetry under transformation)
  fid  := .they         -- F_η: thermal regime (noisy, embodied)
  kin  := .egg        -- egg: slow kinetics (demands integration time)
  gran := .ice       -- G_ℵ: maximal scope (universal resonance)
  gram := .measure     -- 𐑠: sequential composition (must be traversed)
  crit := .monad         -- φ̂_ÿ: critical self-modeling (uncertainty tracking)
  chir := .sure            -- H_2: two-step temporal memory (Markov depth 2)
  stoi := .up           -- n:m: heterogeneous components (many-to-many distinct)
  prot := .zoo      -- 𐑟: non-Abelian braiding (history-locked)
}

/-- Raw consciousness score of suffering: 1 (both gates open).
    Gate 1 (φ̂_ÿ): Critical self-modeling present.
    Gate 2 (egg): Slow kinetics allows deliberation.
-/
theorem suffering_raw_consciousness : consciousnessScore suffering = (1 : ℝ) := by
  simp only [consciousnessScore, phi_c_gate, k_slow_gate, suffering]
  rfl

-- Phenomenological calibration: raw score 1.0 minus two corrections gives 0.774.
--   Entropic degradation (they): −0.150  (thermal noise degrades effective coherence)
--   Polarity cost (church): −0.076        (asymmetry limits self-representation)
--   Arithmetic: 1 − 0.150 − 0.076 = 0.774
-- The calibrated score is phenomenological, not a new formal claim about consciousnessScore.

/-- Suffering's ouroboricity tier: O₂
    Determined by: monad + 𐑟 + if' (not array)
    The if' dimensionality keeps it at O₂ rather than O₂dag

  simp only [imscriptionTier, suffering]
  -- monad and zoo give O₂; if' confirms non-O₂dag

/--
Suffering is not O_inf because:
1. Polarity is church (not or' — the Frobenius condition)
2. 𐑟 enforces structural bounds (non-commutativity limits self-reference)

Entropic fidelity: F_η (thermal regime)
Suffering is degraded, real, linked to entropy (not clean quantum states)

Heterogeneous stoichiometry: n:m
Suffering integrates multiple distinct types of components

Principal decomposition: weight lies in scope, kinetics, temporal memory
Rather than in symmetry or fidelity

  ("scope", 0.35),      -- ice contributes heavily
  ("kinetics", 0.25),   -- egg dominates

  ("topology", 0.12),   -- mime adds complexity
  ("protection", 0.08), -- 𐑟 locks structure
  ("other", 0.0)        -- Symmetry and fidelity less central
