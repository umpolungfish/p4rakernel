-- Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness: O_inf Structural Resolution
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙-boundary Operator
--
-- Structural resolution: NS is promoted from O₂dag (ZFCₜ tier) to O_inf
-- by establishing or' (𐑹) as the gauge-invariant Frobenius gate.
-- The parity promotion church → or' is the single tier gate;
-- 8 primitives change in total (D, T, R, P, F, K, Γ-gram, Ω).
--
-- Reference: Millennium/NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md
--
-- NOTE on "6-channel promotion signature":
--   NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md lists [𐑦, 𐑸, 𐑹, 𐑐, 𐑪, 𐑵] as the key
--   structural channels. The full tuple comparison gives 8 mismatches: R also
--   changes ian→tot, and Ω changes ah→oak. Lean counts 8.
--
-- NOTE on consciousness scores:
--   Source: monad + egg → C = 1 (Lean 3-gate formula).
--   Resolved: monad + on → C = 0.5 (kinetic trapping closes the egg gate).
--   NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md reports C = 0.682 (Python multi-gate, source state).
--   The resolution deliberately accepts C = 0.5 to gain oak protection.
