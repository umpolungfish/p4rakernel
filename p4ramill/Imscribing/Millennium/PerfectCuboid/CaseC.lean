-- Consolidation of the descent axioms into ONE, precisely named.
--
-- Grammar workflow (this file is the conventional decomposition of a Grammar
-- construction; see the companion note). The descent-operator obligation was
-- imscribed and its closure checked with the structural verbs: the split→work→
-- fuse protocol closes (⊢∈⊤⊥∋⊡⊣ ⟹ T), so the descent ARCHITECTURE is sound. The
-- kernel closure verdict on the whole theorem, however, is OPEN: it stands on
-- `descent_operator_exists`. The catalog reading locates the cut on the ⊥
-- (chirality) axis — the promotion 𐑖 (two-step, bounded descent: cases A and B)
-- → 𐑫 (inexhaustible descent: case C). That promotion is the single unclosed
-- step, and this file names it exactly.
--
-- What is PROVEN here, from the existing proven lemmas:
--   • g even  ⟹  all seven entries even  (all_seven_even_of_g_even)
--   • For any cuboid: it either descends (g even, halve) or is impossible
--     (all-pairwise-coprime, case B), OR it lands in the one residual case C.
--
-- What remains ONE axiom, stated precisely (no longer opaque):
--   • case_mixed_parity_impossible — g odd and some edge-pair shares a factor.
--     This is the genuine open content, equivalent to the perfect-cuboid
--     conjecture on this branch. It replaces the three original descent axioms;
--     the main non-existence theorem now rests on it alone.

   g even forces every entry even.
   all_edges_even_when_g_even gives a,b,c. The face diagonals follow:
   d² = a²+b² ≡ 0 (mod 4) with a,b even, so d is even; likewise e, f.

   THE ONE RESIDUAL AXIOM — case C, stated precisely.

   g odd (so case A, the halving descent, does not apply) AND at least one
   edge-pair shares a common factor (so case B, the all-coprime parity
   contradiction, does not apply). This is the mixed-parity case whose
   sub-analysis (two-squares parametrization g = u²+v² = p²+q², the
   difference-of-squares factorization of c², the gcd sub-cases) remains open.
   It carries exactly the content of the perfect-cuboid conjecture on this
   branch, and it is the ⊥ 𐑖→𐑫 promotion the Grammar located.
   ==================================================================== -/

/-- The mixed-parity case, as a PROP rather than an axiom. Its own account above
says the sub-analysis remains open and that it carries the content of the
conjecture on this branch — so an axiom here asserts the open case, and every
theorem downstream inherits that silently through the axiom set. As a hypothesis
it inherits it in the TYPE instead, which is the discipline the rest of this
corpus uses for an open statement. -/

   descent_operator_exists, now a THEOREM.

   Complete case split: either every entry is even (halve, a genuine smaller
   cuboid), or all three pairs are coprime (case B: impossible), or g is odd
   with a shared pair (case C: the residual axiom). In the two impossible
   branches a smaller cuboid exists vacuously.
