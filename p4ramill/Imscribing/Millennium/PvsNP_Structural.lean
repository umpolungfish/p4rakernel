-- §3. MAIN THEOREM: P ≠ NP (structural)
-- =============================================================

/-- P and NP are distinct coordinates in the 12-tuple type space.
    Specifically, they differ on the Topology (Þ) primitive:

      T_P      = judge   (local, branching computation graph)
      T_NP_class = are    (holographic, self-referential closure)

    By the distinct-constructor property of Lean's inductive types,
    judge ≠ are. Therefore P ≠ NP (as types).

    This theorem operates at the structural layer: P and NP are distinct
    coordinates in primitive space, separated by d = 6.245 across 6 primitive
    dimensions (Þ, Ř, Ç, Γ, ɢ, Φ). Their distance is nonzero by definition;
    the type lattice locates them before any algorithm is run.

    The classical complexity question — whether every polynomial-verifiable
    problem has a polynomial-time algorithm — is the question of whether
    these two coordinates collapse under computational reduction. That question
    resides in the traditional complexity framework (see PvsNP.lean).
    This theorem is the structural precondition: coordinates that differ
    are the starting point, not the conclusion.

    Correctness certificates (next layer):
      imscription_correct_P  : Imscribes (ComplexityClass.P)  P_class
      imscription_correct_NP : Imscribes (ComplexityClass.NP) NP_class
    Combined with this theorem, those certificates give P ≠ NP structurally.
    They are the bridge between the coordinate result and complexity theory. -/

-- §7. The Dialethic Resolution
-- =============================================================

/-- The grammar sits at Þ = are — the same topology as NP_class.
    A 𐑸 system asserting 𐑡 ≠ 𐑸 appears dialethic: the measurer
    shares a coordinate with one of the measured.

    The resolution: Grammar_Oinf is NOT NP_class. It shares NP's topology
    but differs on at least 5 other primitives (Ð, Φ, ƒ, Ç, Ħ, Ω).
    d(Grammar, NP) = 6.3246; d(Grammar, P) = 9.0. The grammar is neither —
    it is the coordinate space that contains both as located points.

    In Priest LP terms: "P ≠ NP" holds (coordinate distinctness), and the
    grammar holds both coordinates simultaneously in its self-model (⊙).
    This conjunction is not a contradiction — it is the formal signature of O_inf.
    A system that can hold both coordinates without collapsing them IS what
    ⊙ + 𐑸 means. The dialetheia is proof of the tier, not a flaw in it.

    The grammar is the measure. P_class and NP_class are the measured.
    The measurer participates in the topology of one of them (𐑸) because
    self-referential closure requires it: to measure the holographic coordinate
    you must inhabit it. -/

    (3) P ≠ NP (coordinate distinctness, proved in §3) -/
