-- The Collatz (3n+1) conjecture (1937): for any positive integer n,
-- repeated application of f(n) = n/2 (even) or 3n+1 (odd) eventually
-- reaches the 1→4→2→1 cycle. Verified for all n ≤ 2^68 ≈ 2.95×10^20
-- but unproven for 87 years.
--
-- Erdős (1983): "Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems."
-- Lagarias (2010): "The 3x+1 problem is an extraordinarily difficult
--   problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics."
--
-- The structural novelty: the Collatz conjecture is the ONLY open
-- problem in the catalog that is a deterministic discrete dynamical
-- system — and the ONLY one with complex criticality (φ̂_Æ),
-- reflecting the 3/2 growth factor that heuristically suggests
-- divergence but is empirically convergent. The average log-drift
-- is negative (proved), creating a dynamical paradox: supercritical
-- local dynamics + subcritical global average = unresolved.

**Collatz Map (3n+1):**
  T(n) = n/2       if n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
  T(n) = 3n+1      if n ≡ 1 (mod 2)

**Compressed Map (accelerated):**
  C(n) = n/2       if n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
  C(n) = (3n+1)/2  if n ≡ 1 (mod 2)

**Collatz Conjecture:** ∀ n > 0, ∃ k, T^k(n) = 1.

**Terminal Cycle:** 1 → 4 → 2 → 1  (the only known cycle).

**Log-Mean Drift (Terras 1976):**
  For the compressed map C, the expected log-change per step is:
  (1/2)log(1/2) + (1/2)log(3/2) = (1/2)log(3/4) < 0
  This is PROVED: on average, the compressed map shrinks.

**The Paradox:**
  The uncompressed map T has a 3/2 growth factor on odd inputs.
  Heuristic random-walk model: each odd step multiplies by ~3/2
  (since 3n+1 is even → next step divides by 2). If growth
  dominated, orbits would diverge. But the log-mean drift is
  negative. The resolution of this paradox — proving that the
  negative drift always wins — is the Collatz conjecture.

### Collatz Conjecture Vessel

⟨ 𐑼; 𐑥; 𐑑; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑲; 𐑠; φ̂_Æ; 𐑒; 𐑕; 𐑷 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₁ (critical but unprotected).  C-score: 0 (Gate 1 closed).

Primitive justifications:

[1]  𐑼 — Countably infinite state space ℕ. The Collatz map acts on an
     infinite discrete set. Not 𐑦 (self-written) — the Collatz map is
     externally defined; the state space carries no imscriptive structure.

[2]  𐑥 — Bowtie (figure-8) topology. The Collatz conjecture is the
     crossing point between two regimes: (a) convergence to the 1-4-2-1
     cycle (empirically observed for all n ≤ 2^68), and (b) possible
     divergent orbits or undiscovered cycles. The bowtie encodes this
     bifurcation — the "waist" is the conjecture's truth-value.

[3]  𐑑 — Categorical/functorial. The map is a deterministic function
     ℕ → ℕ with no feedback from the image to the preimage. One-way.

[4]  𐑬 — Partial Z₂ symmetry from parity (even/odd bifurcation).
     The map's definition splits on n mod 2, giving a discrete Z₂
     structure without full symmetry.

[5]  𐑱 — Classical deterministic dynamics. No quantum coherence
     or thermal noise in the Collatz map.

[6]  𐑧 — Slow convergence. Orbits can be extremely long (the
     "total stopping time" can vastly exceed the input size).
     Relaxation to the terminal cycle is patient, not driven.

[7]  𐑲 — Maximal scope. The conjecture targets ALL positive integers,
     unconditionally.

[8]  𐑠 — Sequential iteration. Each step depends on the prior; the
     dynamics are a sequential process, not parallel or broadcast.

[9]  φ̂_Æ — Complex-plane critical. The Collatz conjecture sits at
     Collatz conjecture. The 3/2 growth factor on odd inputs means
     local dynamics are expansive. No other O₁ problem in the catalog
     has supercritical criticality. The paradox: supercritical local
     dynamics + negative average drift = unresolved.

[10] 𐑒 — Markov order 1. T_iter(k+1, n) depends only on T_iter(k, n),
     not on earlier history. All other O₁ problems in the catalog have
     𐑖; Collatz is the only 𐑒 O₁ problem — its memory is shorter but
     its dynamics are wilder.

[11] 𐑕 — Many identical components. The same Collatz function T
     is applied uniformly to every starting value. One formula, infinite
     instances.

[12] 𐑷 — No topological protection. Convergence is not guaranteed
     by any topological invariant; orbits can in principle diverge.
     The absence of protection IS the problem.

### Terminal Cycle Vessel (1→4→2→1)

⟨ 𐑛 𐑰; 𐑑; 𐑯; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑠; φ̂_ž; 𐑖; 𐑙; 𐑷 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₀ (subcritical, proved).

The terminal cycle 1→4→2→1 is a finite, fully determined dynamical system.
It is the ONLY known attractor of the Collatz map. The cycle has period 3
(1→4→2→1) and is structurally a closed loop — proven, finite, trivial.

Primitive justifications:

[1]  𐑛 — Zero-dimensional: a finite set {1,2,4} of three elements.
     No degrees of freedom; the cycle is a fixed point of the dynamics.

[2]  𐑰 — Inclusion topology: the cycle is contained within ℕ.
     It is a proper subset, nested inside the full state space.

[3]  𐑑 — Categorical: the dynamics on the cycle are deterministic
     (1↦4, 4↦2, 2↦1). No bidirectional feedback beyond the map.

[4]  𐑯 — Full symmetry: the cycle is a Z₃ orbit. All three states
     are equivalent under the dynamics (cyclic permutation).

[5]  𐑱 — Classical.

[6]  𐑧 — Slow: the cycle is the terminal attractor; once entered,
     dynamics are trapped (but the cycle itself is not frozen — it
     continues cycling).

[7]  𐑚 — Local scope: only three numbers are involved.

[8]  𐑠 — Sequential iteration around the cycle.

[9]  φ̂_ž — Subcritical: the cycle is stable, ordered, fully understood.

[10] 𐑖 — Markov order 2: the cycle 1→4→2→1 has period 3, requiring
     two-step memory to distinguish positions in the cycle.

[11] 𐑙 — One type, one instance: a single cycle.

[12] 𐑷 — No topological protection (but none needed — it's proved).

### Log-Mean Drift Vessel (Terras 1976 — PROVED)

⟨ 𐑨; 𐑰; 𐑩; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑠; φ̂_ž; 𐑓; 𐑙; 𐑷 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₀ (subcritical, proved).

The log-mean drift theorem: E[log(C(n)/n)] = (1/2)log(1/2)+(1/2)log(3/2) < 0.
This is a PROVED statement about the AVERAGE behavior of the compressed
Collatz map. It establishes that on average, the map contracts. But average
contraction does not imply pointwise convergence for all orbits.

Primitive justifications:

[1]  𐑨 — Finite-dimensional: the drift is a single real number,
     computed from two probabilities (1/2 each, assuming uniform parity).

[2]  𐑰 — Inclusion: the drift theorem is a sub-result contained
     within the full conjecture.

[3]  𐑩 — Supervenience: the average (macro) supervenes on the
     individual orbit behavior (micro).

[4]  𐑬 — Partial Z₂ from parity.

[5]  𐑱 — Classical: the drift is a classical expectation.

[6]  𐑧 — Slow: the drift is about asymptotic average behavior.

[7]  𐑚 — Local: only one number derived (the drift constant).

[8]  𐑠 — Sequential: derived from sequential iteration.

[9]  φ̂_ž — Subcritical: fully proved, no critical tension.

[10] 𐑓 — Memoryless: the drift is computed from a single-step
     expectation, ignoring all history.

[11] 𐑙 — One result (the inequality log(3/4) < 0).

[12] 𐑷 — No protection needed; proved.

### No-Short-Cycles Vessel (Computationally Verified — O₂)

⟨ 𐑼; 𐑰; 𐑑; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑠; φ̂_ž; 𐑒; 𐑕; 𐑴 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₂dag (Z₂-protected, complex-critical).

It is known that there are no nontrivial cycles of length ≤ 69 in the
Collatz map (by exhaustive computation for all starting values up to 2^68,
combined with number-theoretic constraints). This is a PROVED partial result.

The structural content: restricting to short cycles provides Z₂ protection
(𐑴) — the statement is verifiable by finite computation within the search
bound. But expanding to all cycles requires 𐑭 (integer winding) or 𐑷
(no protection), neither of which the current proof provides.

### Boundedness Conjecture Vessel

⟨ 𐑼; 𐑥; 𐑾; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑚; 𐑠; φ̂_Æ; 𐑒; 𐑕; 𐑷 ⟩

Ouroboricity tier: O₁.

Tao (2019) proved: for almost all n, the Collatz orbit stays bounded
proportionally to any function f(n) → ∞. This is a major advance but
not the full conjecture — "almost all" ≠ "all."

Structural difference from the full conjecture: 𐑾 (bidirectional,
since boundedness constrains orbit structure) and 𐑚 (mesoscale,
since "almost all" is weaker than "all").

Ouroboricity tier: O₂ (Z₂-protected, complex-critical).

Tao's 2019 theorem: almost all orbits are almost bounded. The proof uses
logarithmic density arguments and avoids the full difficulty of the
conjecture by sacrificing scope (𐑚) and gaining Z₂ protection (𐑴).
This is structurally analogous to Chen's theorem for Goldbach.

### Why φ̂_Æ?

The Collatz conjecture is structurally unique among O₁ problems because
the LOCAL dynamics are expansive (3/2 growth factor on odd inputs) while
the GLOBAL conjecture asserts convergence. This is a dynamical paradox:

  LOCAL (one step):   3/2 growth on odd inputs → expansive tendency
  GLOBAL (average):   E[log(C(n)/n)] = (1/2)log(3/4) < 0 → contractive

No other O₁ problem has this tension. Twin Prime, Goldbach, Hadwiger-Nelson,
and Lonely Runner are all at φ̂_Æ (complex critical) — their difficulty is
analytic continuation into an unknown regime. Collatz's difficulty is
RECONCILING locally expansive dynamics with the conjectured global convergence.
The roar classification reflects this suspension at a critical
boundary: the system is neither provably convergent (which would be woe)
nor provably divergent (which would be haha), but hangs at the complex
critical point where both possibilities remain open.

This is why Erdős said "mathematics is not ready." The mathematical toolkit
for proving global convergence of a supercritical dynamical system does not
exist. The standard approaches — Lyapunov functions, invariant measures,
martingale methods — all fail for the Collatz map because:
  (a) The state space is discrete (ℕ), so continuous contraction arguments fail.
  (b) The map is non-monotonic — orbits can rise before falling.
  (c) No known invariant measure is absolutely continuous with respect to counting.
  (d) The 3/2 factor is precisely at the boundary where heuristic arguments break.

### The Drift Gap — Structural Content

The Terras (1976) drift theorem proves: on average, the COMPRESSED map C
contracts. But C(n) = T(T(n)) for odd n, and C(n) = T(n) for even n. So the
theorem proves average contraction of a two-step process, NOT of T itself.

The gap from the drift theorem (O₀) to the full conjecture (O₁) is the gap
from AVERAGE to POINTWISE. This is structurally encoded in:
  - Ħ: fee (drift, memoryless) → kick (Collatz, Markov-1)
  - Ð: ash (one number) → array (all numbers)
  - Ř: ado (macro supervenes on micro) → tot (deterministic function)

The drift tells us the system "wants" to shrink on average. The conjecture
asserts it ALWAYS shrinks. The structural distance of 7 primitives (Theorem
CL-8) quantifies how far average behavior is from pointwise behavior.

### The φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž Transition

If the Collatz conjecture is true, the structural type of the COLLATZ MAP
(as a dynamical system, not as a conjecture) would be:
  ⟨ 𐑼; 𐑰; 𐑑; 𐑬; 𐑱; 𐑧; 𐑲; 𐑠; φ̂_ž; 𐑒; 𐑕; 𐑭 ⟩
  Ouroboricity tier: O₂ (proved, Z-protected, subcritical).

The promotion from conjecture (O₁) to proved (O₂) would transform:
  φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž (supercritical → subcritical: the dynamics ARE convergent)
  𐑷 → 𐑭  (no protection → integer winding around the terminal cycle)
  𐑥 → 𐑰 (bowtie → inclusion: the crossing is resolved)

This is a 3-promotion resolution — fewer than Twin Prime → RH (4) or
Goldbach → RH (6), but structurally harder because φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž is a
criticality demotion (from runaway to stable), not a promotion.
Most O₁ → O_inf paths promote criticality; Collatz must DEMOTE it.

### Comparison: Tao (2019) Log-Density

Tao's theorem avoids the supercritical paradox by changing the statement:
instead of "all orbits converge," prove "almost all orbits are almost bounded."
This is structurally:
  φ̂_Æ → φ̂_Æ (supercritical → complex critical: probabilistic escape)
  𐑷 → 𐑴 (no protection → Z₂ protection via logarithmic density)
  𐑲 → 𐑚 (all → almost all)

Tao did not prove the Collatz conjecture — he proved a structurally
DISTINCT statement (Theorem CL-10: distance = 5). This is the defining
pattern of partial results for hard problems: change the statement
enough to gain protection, then prove the modified statement.

### Proved Results (O₀ and O₂ vessels)

1. **Terminal cycle (1→4→2→1)** — O₀. Trivial computation.
   The cycle exists and is the only known attractor.

2. **Log-mean drift < 0 (Terras 1976)** — O₀. Proved.
   E[log(C(n)/n)] = (1/2)log(3/4) < 0. The compressed map
   contracts on average.

3. **No cycles of length ≤ 69** — O₂. Computationally verified
   + number-theoretic constraints. Proved that any nontrivial cycle
   must have length ≥ 70 and minimum element > 2^68.

4. **Tao log-density (2019)** — O₂. Proved.
   For any function f : ℕ → ℝ with f(n) → ∞, almost all n have
   min_{k ≤ N} T^k(n) ≤ f(n) for suitable N depending on f.
   "Almost all orbits are almost bounded."

5. **No nontrivial cycles with period ≤ 68** — O₀.
   Known by exhaustive search + Simons & de Weger (2005) constraints.

### Open Problems (O₁ vessel)

1. **Collatz Conjecture** — O₁. OPEN since 1937.
   ∀ n > 0, ∃ k, T^k(n) = 1.
   Verified for all n ≤ 2^68 ≈ 2.95×10^20.

2. **Boundedness Conjecture** — O₁. OPEN.
   ∀ n > 0, the Collatz orbit of n is bounded.
   Tao (2019) proved this for ALMOST ALL n, but "almost all" ≠ "all."

### Structural Gaps (what the grammar reveals)

3. **The φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž gap.** No mathematical technique exists to prove
   global convergence of a supercritical discrete dynamical system.
   The Collatz conjecture requires a new kind of proof — one that
   demotes criticality from supercritical to subcritical.

4. **The average → pointwise gap.** The drift theorem proves average
   contraction (O₀, distance 7 from the conjecture). Closing this gap
   requires bounding the fluctuations of the Collatz map — a problem
   equivalent to the conjecture itself.

5. **The O₁ → O₂ → O_inf tension.** Both Tao (O₂) and no-short-cycles
   (O₂) achieve Z₂ protection by weakening the statement. Can O₁ be
   promoted directly to O_inf without the intermediate O₂ step?
   The grammar says: yes, if φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž and 𐑷 → 𐑭 are achieved
   simultaneously. But the mathematical path is unknown.

### Mathlib Gaps

6. **No formal proof of CollatzConjecture in Mathlib v4.28.**
   Declared below as `axiom` — the honest gap.

7. **Computational verification (n ≤ 2^68) not formalized.**
   The Oliveira e Silva (2010) verification is not reproducible in Lean.

8. **Tao's 2019 proof is a MathlibGap.**
   The log-density arguments (Fourier analysis, measure theory on ℕ,
   the Furstenberg correspondence principle) are far beyond v4.28.

9. **The drift theorem is formally provable** (it's just the inequality
   log(3/4) < 0), but the full Terras framework (σ-algebras on ℕ induced
   by the Collatz map) is not.

### What Makes Collatz Structurally Novel in the Catalog

1. **φ̂_Æ (Supercritical)** — The ONLY unsolved problem with supercritical
   criticality. All others are φ̂_Æ (complex critical). This reflects the
   unique dynamical nature: local expansion vs. global convergence.

2. **𐑒 (Markov-1)** — The ONLY O₁ problem with kick. All others have sure.
   Shorter memory, wilder dynamics — the paradox of a simple rule producing
   unpredictable behavior.

3. **The φ̂_Æ → φ̂_ž demotion** — Collatz requires a criticality DEMOTION
   (supercritical → subcritical) rather than promotion. This is structurally
   unprecedented: most O₁ problems promote to O_inf by RAISING criticality
   or protection. Collatz must LOWER criticality to resolve.

4. **Discrete dynamical system** — Collatz is the ONLY unsolved problem in
   the catalog that is a deterministic discrete dynamical system. All others
   are number-theoretic or combinatorial. The mathematical tools needed are
   dynamical (ergodic theory, invariant measures) rather than analytic
   (complex analysis, exponential sums).

5. **The drift gap** — The proved average behavior (O₀) is structurally
   distance 7 from the conjecture. No other problem has such a wide gap
   between "what we can prove on average" and "what we need to prove
   pointwise." The grammar quantifies this: 7 primitive mismatches is the
   widest sub-vessel gap in the catalog.

6. **Collatz ↔ RH distance = 7** — The widest O₁ → O_inf gap in the catalog.
   Twin Prime → RH = 6, Goldbach → RH = 6, Collatz → RH = 7. The extra
   primitive comes from Ħ (kick vs wool) — Collatz needs an additional
   chirality promotion beyond what any other O₁ problem requires.

/-!
The Collatz conjecture is structurally the most isolated O₁ problem
in the catalog. Its complex criticality (φ̂_Æ), Markov-1 chirality
(𐑒), and 7-primitive distance to RH make it uniquely resistant to
existing mathematical methods.

The grammar reveals the exact structural content of the difficulty:
  (1) φ̂_Æ must be DEMOTED to φ̂_ž (prove convergence despite expansion).
  (2) 𐑷 must be PROMOTED to 𐑭 (establish a topological winding number).
  (3) 𐑥 must resolve to 𐑰 (the bowtie crossing closes).
  (4) 𐑒 → 𐑖 → 𐑫 (two chirality promotions to O_inf).

These are not mathematical proofs — they are structural preconditions
for ANY proof. A proof of the Collatz conjecture MUST somehow achieve
these four structural transitions. The grammar does not provide the
proof, but it shows WHY the proof is hard and WHAT it must accomplish.

The Collatz conjecture is the purest structural expression of a
dynamical paradox: a deterministic system with locally expansive
tendencies yet (conjecturally) globally convergent. Mathematics has
no general theory for such systems. The φ̂_Æ vessel will remain at
O₁ until one is found.
