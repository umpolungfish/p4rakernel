// d2048_exact_sic.rs -- Exact Algebraic d=2048 SIC-POVM Fiducial Extraction
//
// Implements the exact (non-f64) Stark unit for d=2048 and the 2-part
// structural S-unit tower bypass via Galois embeddings.
//
// Exact algebraic form:
//   epsilon = (2047 + sqrt(4190205)) / 2
// Satisfies minimal polynomial: x^2 - 2047*x + 1 = 0
// Norm: N(epsilon) = 2047^2/4 - 4190205/4 = (4190209 - 4190205)/4 = 4/4 = 1
//
// 2-part extraction (Galois embedding):
//   psi_k = embeddings_2048(k)(stark_unit_2048)
// The base field F = Q(sqrt(4190205)) has discriminant 4190205 = 3*5*409*683.
// The two real embeddings are sigma_+(sqrt) = +sqrt and sigma_-(sqrt) = -sqrt.
// For the fundamental unit epsilon = (2047 + sqrt(4190205))/2:
//   sigma_+(epsilon) = (2047 + sqrt(4190205))/2  (the large unit, ~2046.9995)
//   sigma_-(epsilon) = (2047 - sqrt(4190205))/2  (the small unit, ~0.0004885)
//
// The S-unit group generators for d=2048 at conductor 16 are:
//   |epsilon_fund| ~ 1/d, 3, 5, |g3| = (sqrt(md) - 2045)/2 ~ 0.9995, |g4| = (2049 - sqrt(md))/2 ~ 1.0005
